There's the Moodle Agent and the Calendar Agent. The Moodle Agent handles course management, assignments, and user info. The Calendar Agent deals with event scheduling and calendar management.\n\nThe user wants to know what I can do. I should explain both tools briefly. But wait, the original goal was \"What are your capabilities?\" So I need to list both agents' functions without getting too detailed. \n\nI should mention that I can manage Moodle courses, track assignments, and retrieve user information. For the Calendar Agent, I can create, update, retrieve, and search events. Also, note that I use ReAct reasoning to route requests properly.\n\nWait, the user might not need the technical details. Just a high-level overview. Make sure to highlight the main functions of each agent. Also, mention that I can handle both Moodle and calendar tasks. \n\nCheck if there's any missing info. The tools' descriptions are in the TOOLS_SNAPSHOT, so I should reference that. But since the user is asking about capabilities, not the tools themselves, I should present it as the functions I can perform. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is clear and concise, covering both agents' main purposes. No need to go into parameters or examples unless necessary. Just the capabilities. \n\nAlright, that should cover it. Let me structure the answer to include both Moodle and Calendar functions, mentioning the ReAct reasoning part as well.\n</think>\n\nI can manage Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) operations and calendar event scheduling. For Moodle, I can:  \n- Retrieve enrolled courses, search courses by name, inspect course contents, view assignments (with optional date filtering), and access personal user information.  \nFor calendar events, I can:  \n- Create, update, retrieve, or search events via Google Calendar integration.  \nI use ReAct reasoning to route requests to the appropriate tools.  \n\nFinal:  \n```evidence-json\n{\n  \"moodle-agent\": {\n    \"description\": \"The Moodle Agent is a specialized AI assistant for Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) operations.
