There's the get_calendar_events tool which requires start_date and end_date in RFC3339 format.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the current date and time. The system message says the current date is 2025-09-29T08:11:19.193Z. The next 7 days would be from 2025-10-06 (since adding 7 days to September 29th would be October 6th, but considering the time, maybe October 5th? Wait, let me calculate. September has 30 days, so September 29 + 7 days is October 6. But the current time is 08:11, so if the user wants the next 7 days starting from today, the start date should be 2025-10-06, but maybe the end date is 2025-10-13. Wait, no, the next 7 days would be from the current date (Sep 29) to the next 7 days, which would be Oct 6. But the tool's parameters are start_date and end_date. So the start_date should be the current date, and end_date should be 7 days later. Wait, but the user is asking for the next 7 days, so maybe the start_date is today (Sep 29) and end_date is 7 days from today, which would be Oct 6. But the tool's parameters are in RFC3339, so I need to format them correctly.\n\nWait, the current date is 2025-09-29T08:11:19.193Z. The next 7 days would be from 2025-10-06 (since 29 + 7 days is 6th of October). But the end date should be the start date plus 7 days. So start_date is 2025-09-29T00:00:00Z and end_date is 2025-10-06T23:59:59Z? Or maybe the end date is 7 days after the start date. Wait, the user wants events in the next 7 days, so the start date should be today (Sep 29) and the end date should be 7 days from today, which is Oct 6. But the exact time might matter. However, the tool's parameters are for start_date and end_date, which are in RFC3339 format. So I need to set start_date as the current date (Sep 29) and end_date as 7 days later (Oct 6). But the exact time might need to be considered. However, since the user is asking for the next 7 days, it's likely that the start_date is the current date (Sep 29) and end_date is 7 days from now, which would be Oct 6. So the parameters would be start_date: \"2025-09-29T00:00:00Z\" and end_date: \"2025-10-06T23:59:59Z\". \n\nBut wait, the current time is 08:11, so if the user wants the next 7 days starting from now, maybe the start_date is the current date (Sep 29) and end_date is 7 days from now, which is Oct 6. However, the tool's parameters might require the start and end dates to be in the same day. Alternatively, maybe the start_date is the current date (Sep 29) and end_date is 7 days later (Oct 6). So I need to call get_calendar_events with those dates. \n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't provided any previous data, so the initial state has no calls. Therefore, the first step is to call get_calendar_events with the start_date and end_date set to the next 7 days. The tool requires those parameters, so I need to construct them correctly. \n\nSo the correct function call would be get_calendar_events with start_date as \"2025-09-29T00:00:00Z\" and end_date as \"2025-10-06T23:59:59Z\". That should retrieve all events in the next 7 days. Then, the response from the tool would be the events, which can be processed to list them. Since the user's original goal is to list the events, this is the first step. Therefore, the assistant should call get_calendar_events with those dates.\n</think>\n\nCALL: get_calendar_events\nparameters=\"start_date=\\\"2025-09-29T00:00:00Z\\\", end_date=\\\"2025-10-06T23:59:59Z\\\"\"",

The current date is September 29, 2025, so the next 7 days would end on October 6, 2025.\n\nLooking at the STATE_JSON provided, there's already a call to get_calendar_events with start_date as 2025-09-29T00:00:00Z and end_date as 2025-10-06T23:59:59Z. The result from that call shows 1 event named \"Study Block\". The event starts on September 29 at 12:00 PM and ends on October 13 at 1:30 PM. The recurrence rule is weekly on Monday and Wednesday.\n\nWait, the end date of the event is October 13, which is beyond the 7-day window. But the event is weekly, so it will repeat every Monday and Wednesday. However, the user is only asking for the next 7 days, which includes September 29 to October 6. The Study Block event on September 29 is within this period, but the next occurrence would be October 6 (Wednesday) and October 13 (Monday), but October 13 is outside the 7-day window. So within the next 7 days, there's the event on September 29 and the next one on October 6 (if that's within the range). Wait, October 6 is a Monday, so that's within the 7 days. Wait, the end_date is October 6, so the event on October 6 would be included. But the original event's end date is October 13, but since it's weekly, the next occurrence is October 6 (Monday) and then October 13 (Monday again). But the user's query is for the next 7 days, which ends on October 6. So the event on October 6 is included. However, the initial call's result shows the event's end date as October 13, but that's the end of the first occurrence. The recurrence rule is weekly, so each occurrence ends when the next one starts. Wait, maybe the end date in the event is the end of the first occurrence, and the recurrence rule defines how often it repeats. So the event on September 29 starts at 12 PM and ends at 1:30 PM. Then the next occurrence is October 6 (Monday) at 12 PM, ending at 1:30 PM. The next one would be October 13, but that's beyond the 7-day window. So within the next 7 days (September 29 to October 6), there are two events: September 29 and October 6. But the tool response only shows one event. Wait, maybe the tool's response is only showing the first occurrence, but the recurrence rule indicates that it's weekly. However, the tool's result says \"We found 1 calendar events\", which might be because the query parameters are set to end_date October 6, and the event's recurrence is weekly. But the tool's response might not be showing all instances within the date range. Alternatively, maybe the tool's result is only showing the first occurrence, and the recurrence is handled by the RRULE. But the user's query is for the next 7 days, so the answer should list all events that occur within that period. However, the tool's result only shows one event. But according to the tool's response, there's one event with the recurrence rule, which means it's recurring every Monday and Wednesday. So within the next 7 days, there are two events: September 29 (Monday) and October 6 (Monday). Wait, but the start date is September 29, and the end date is October 6. The event's start is 2025-09-29T12:00:00+02:00, and the end is 2025-10-13T13:30:00+02:00. The recurrence is weekly on Monday and Wednesday. So the first occurrence is September 29 (Monday), then October 6 (Monday), and October 13 (Monday). But the end_date in the tool's response is October 6, so the event on October 6 is within the range. However, the tool's result only shows one event. Maybe the tool's response is not showing all instances but just the first one, and the recurrence is handled by the RRULE. But the user is asking for the next 7 days, so the answer should include both September 29 and October 6. However, the tool's result only shows one event. This might be a limitation of the tool's response. Alternatively, maybe the tool's response is correct, and the event is recurring, but the user's query is for the next 7 days, so the answer should list the events that occur within that period. But according to the tool's result, there's only one event. Wait, the tool's result says \"We found 1 calendar events\" with the recurrence rule. So the answer should list that event, noting that it's recurring every Monday and Wednesday. But the user is asking for the next 7 days, so the answer should mention that the event occurs on September 29 and October 6 (if within the 7 days). However, the tool's response only shows the first occurrence. Therefore, the answer should state that there is one recurring event named \"Study Block\" starting on September 29 at 12:00 PM, recurring every Monday and Wednesday, with the next occurrence on October 6. But the tool's result might not show all instances, so the answer should be based on the provided data. The user's original goal is to list the calendar events for the next 7 days, and the tool's result shows one event with a recurrence rule. Therefore, the answer should list that event, noting the recurrence and the dates it occurs within the 7-day window.\n</think>\n\nDONE:\n```evidence-json\n{\n  \"id\": \"9dmo66blf1c0eclcrkm6aupckc\",\n  \"summary\": \"Study Block\",\n  \"start\": \"2025-09-29T12:00:00+02:00\",\n  \"end\": \"2025-10-13T13:30:00+02:00\",\n  \"htmlLink\": \"https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=OWRtbzY2YmxmMWMwZWNsY3JrbTZhdXBja2NfMjAyNTA5MjlUMTAwMDAwWiBjcmltcGFsdEBt\",\n  \"recurrence\": \"0: RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE\"\n}\n```\nFinal:\nThere is 1 calendar event for the next 7 days:  \n**Study Block**  \nStarts: 2025-09-29T12:00:00+02:00  \nEnds: 2025-10-13T13:30:00+02:00  \nRecurrence: Weekly on Monday and Wednesday  \nEvent ID: 9dmo66blf1c0eclcrkm6aupckc  \nEvent link: https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=OWRtbzY2YmxmMWMwZWNsY3JrbTZhdXBja2NfMjAyNTA5MjlUMTAwMDAwWiBjcmltcGFsdEBt",

There's the get_calendar_events tool which requires start_date and end_date in RFC3339 format.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the current date and time. The system message says the current date is 2025-09-29T08:11:19.193Z. The next 7 days would be from 2025-10-06 (since adding 7 days to September 29th would be October 6th, but considering the time, maybe October 5th? Wait, let me calculate. September has 30 days, so September 29 + 7 days is October 6. But the current time is 08:11, so if the user wants the next 7 days starting from today, the start date should be 2025-10-06, but maybe the end date is 2025-10-13. Wait, no, the next 7 days would be from the current date (Sep 29) to the next 7 days, which would be Oct 6. But the tool's parameters are start_date and end_date. So the start_date should be the current date, and end_date should be 7 days later. Wait, but the user is asking for the next 7 days, so maybe the start_date is today (Sep 29) and end_date is 7 days from today, which would be Oct 6. But the exact time might matter. However, the tool's parameters are in RFC3339, so I need to format them correctly.\n\nWait, the current date is 2025-09-29T08:11:19.193Z. The next 7 days would be from 2025-10-06 (since 29 + 7 days is 6th of October). But the end date should be the start date plus 7 days. So start_date is 2025-09-29T00:00:00Z and end_date is 2025-10-06T23:59:59Z? Or maybe the end date is 7 days after the start date. However, the user is asking for the next 7 days, so the start_date is the current date (Sep 29) and end_date is 7 days from now, which is Oct 6. So the parameters would be start_date: \"2025-09-29T00:00:00Z\" and end_date: \"2025-10-06T23:59:59Z\". \n\nBut wait, the current time is 08:11, so if the user wants the next 7 days starting from now, maybe the start_date is the current date (Sep 29) and end_date is 7 days from now, which is Oct 6. However, the tool's parameters might require the start and end dates to be in the same day. Alternatively, maybe the start_date is the current date (Sep 29) and end_date is 7 days later (Oct 6). So I need to call get_calendar_events with those dates.\n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't provided any previous data, so the initial state has no calls. Therefore, the first step is to call get_calendar_events with the start_date and end_date set to the next 7 days.
