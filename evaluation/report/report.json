The user wants to get their last past assignment and create a calendar event for the assignment date and 1.5 hours, with the description being the assignment intro.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the previous interactions. The user already had an assignment called \\\\\\\"Wireframe Design\\\\\\\" with a due date on 2025-11-15. The calendar event was created with start time 19:17 and end at 20:47, but the observation showed the start time adjusted to 20:17+01:00. The user mentioned that the event was successfully created, so maybe that's already done. \\n\\nBut the user is asking again, so maybe they want confirmation or check again. But according to the rules, if the goal is already satisfied, I should output DONE. The lastObservation indicates success, so the answer is already provided. The evidence from the state shows the event was created, so I don't need to call any tools again. \\n\\nI need to make sure I don't repeat the function calls. Since the task is done, I should just present the final answer with the event details as they are in the state.\\n\\nSo, the correct response is to use DONE and include the evidence JSON from the last observation, then provide the final answer with the event details as they are in the state.\\\",\\n  \\\"structured_thought\\\": {\\\"function_calls\\\": [\\\"calendar-agent\\\"], \\\"is_finished\\\": false},\\n  \\\"response\\\": \\\"[\\\\n  \\\\\\\"[\\\\n  \\\\\\\"SUMMARY: The original goal was to schedule a calendar event for the assignment \\\\\\\"Wireframe Design\\\\\\\" with start time 2025-11-15T19:17:00 and end time 2025-11-15T20:47:00, description: \\\\\\\"Create wireframes for a digital health application.\\\\\\\" The current overall status is **success**, as the event was successfully created.  \\\\n\\\\nConcrete results available now include:  \\\\n- **Event ID**: `mplu4vuu4qcktlkgepmj5oabg0`  \\\\n- **Event summary**: \\\\\\\"Wireframe Design\\\\\\\"  \\\\n- **Start time**: 2025-11-15T20:17:00+01:00  \\\\n- **End time**: 2025-11-15T21:47:00+01:00  \\\\n- **Description**: \\\\\\\"Create wireframes for a digital health application.\\\\\\\"  \\\\n- **View event**: [Google Calendar Link](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bXBsdTR2dXU0cWNrdGxrZ2VwbWo1b2FiZzAgY3JpbXBhbHRAbQ)  \\\\n\\\\nThe event was created with the specified description and duration, though the start time in the observation (20:17:00+01:00) differs slightly from the original request (19:17:00).
