There's the Moodle Agent and the Calendar Agent. The Moodle Agent can handle course management, assignments, and user info. The Calendar Agent deals with event scheduling and calendar management.\n\nThe user wants to know what I can do. I should explain both tools clearly. But wait, the original goal was \"What are your capabilities?\" So I need to list both agents' functions without getting too technical.\n\nWait, the system message says to speak in first person and professionally. So I should structure the answer as a summary of the two agents. Make sure to mention the Moodle Agent's abilities like retrieving courses, assignments, user info. Then the Calendar Agent's CRUD operations and event management.\n\nAlso, check if the STATE has any relevant info. The last action is empty, so no previous calls. So I can directly answer without needing to call any tools. The user isn't asking for specific data but general capabilities. So the answer should be a high-level overview of both agents' functions.\n\nMake sure to follow the rules: no markdown, use first person, and be concise. Also, since there's no need to call a tool here, just provide the answer. But wait, the initial instruction says if the goal is satisfied, use DONE. But in this case, the user is asking for capabilities, which is a general question. The system might not have any data yet, so maybe I should explain the tools available.\n\nWait, the tools are part of the system, so I should describe them as the agents. So the answer would be that I can assist with Moodle course management, assignments, user info, and calendar events, scheduling, etc. That's the capabilities.
