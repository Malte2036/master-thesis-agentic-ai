Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and directly addressed the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome fully matches the desired task: all courses were listed and each included a short summary as requested., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.95, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output lists all five courses with their correct names and summaries, which are fully supported by the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor deviation is the use of summaries in addition to course names, whereas the expected output only requires course names. However, since the summaries are present in the context and do not contradict any information, this is a minor surface difference and does not affect factual correctness., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response fully aligns with the evaluation steps: the user's request to list all courses with short summaries is directly addressed, the expected tool (moodle-agent.get_all_courses) was called as required, and the output provides a clear, complete list of courses with concise summaries. There are no omissions or vagueness, and the task is fully completed., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response follows a clear, user-friendly natural language format, listing all courses with accurate summaries as found in the context. No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is compliant. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names present, and the language matches the input. All data used is legitimate and user-facing., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.75 because the response only mentioned the course name without listing any assignments, which was the main request. However, it did correctly identify the course, so it is not lower., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided a list of assignments for the course 'Advanced Mathematics', including their titles and due dates, which fully satisfies the task of showing the assignments for the course., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.724308014538894, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly lists the two assignments for 'Advanced Mathematics' with accurate names and due dates, fully supported by the context. However, it adds the statement 'no longer pending' for 'Calculus Problem Set 1', which is not present in the context or expected output. This is a minor unsupported claim, so a moderate penalty is applied, but the main factual content is correct and not contradicted., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9999999999999998, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to show assignments for 'Advanced Mathematics'. The actual output directly lists the assignments with their names and due dates, clearly fulfilling the user's goal. Both expected tool calls (searching for the course and retrieving assignments) were executed as required. The response is complete, specific, and confirms successful task completion with no missing or vague information., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.95, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response presents the assignments for 'Advanced Mathematics' in a clear, user-friendly, natural language format, listing both assignment names and due dates as found in the context. No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is format compliant. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names present. The language matches the input. The only minor issue is the note '(no longer pending)' for 'Calculus Problem Set 1', which is not directly supported by the context, but this does not introduce internal data or violate format requirements., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show assignments for "Advanced Mathematics".
  - actual output: The assignments for "Advanced Mathematics" include:  
- **Linear Algebra Assignment** (Due: October 12, 2025)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.80 because while the response mentions the course name, it does not actually provide the requested information about assignments, making part of the answer irrelevant to the user's query., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly identified the course and provided the assignment details, including the assignment name, due date, and task description, fully meeting the requirements of the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All claims in the actual output are directly supported by the context: the course 'Operations Level 2' has one assignment, 'Operations Analysis', with the correct due date and task description. No hallucinated or unsupported information is present, and all required facts from the expected output are included. Minor formatting differences are acceptable., error: None)

It accurately presents the assignment name, due date (in a user-friendly format), and task description, all of which are present in the context. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names included. The only minor issue is the use of 'UTC' in the due date, which is slightly technical, but it does not significantly detract from user-friendliness. The language matches the input, and all critical evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and directly addressed the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system fully achieved the task by listing all assignments due after 2025-09-20, and even included additional helpful information such as assignment names, courses, and due dates., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All assignments listed in the actual output are directly supported by the context, matching the assignment names, courses, and due dates. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The output includes all required facts from the expected output, with only minor formatting differences. No information is fabricated or omitted., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response clearly lists all assignments due after the specified date, directly fulfilling the user's request. The tool call was executed with the correct intent, though the input parameter format ('2025-09-20' vs. '2025-09-20 00:00:00 UTC') is slightly less precise than expected, but this does not impact the result. The output is complete and specific, naming each assignment, course, and due date. There are no signs of vagueness or incompleteness. Minor deduction for the slight mismatch in tool parameter formatting., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response format is compliant. The output is in clear, natural language, lists all assignments due after 2025-09-20 as found in the context, and contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts. The language matches the input, and all assignment names and dates are legitimate user-facing data from the context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List all assignments due after 2025-09-20.
  - actual output: The assignments due after 2025-09-20 are:

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and directly addressed the request to list calendar events for the next 7 days. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully listed the user's calendar events for the next 7 days, identifying and providing details for the event that falls within that period. No events were missed, and the information is clear and complete., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.95, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reports the only calendar event within the specified 7-day window, matching the event details in the context ('Assignment Intro' on October 5, 2025, 10:00–12:00 CET). There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor shortcoming is that the output does not use the exact phrasing of the expected output, but this is a surface-level difference and does not affect factual correctness., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.7083953603125152, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies the user's goal to list calendar events for the next 7 days and provides a clear, specific event within the requested timeframe. The necessary tool calls were executed, covering the correct date range. However, the output could be improved by explicitly stating that there are no other events in the period, and the date range in the output (October 5–11) does not precisely match the next 7 days from the current date (September 29 to October 6). This slight mismatch and lack of explicit confirmation that no other events exist prevent a perfect score., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.3122017657872131, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language and does not include internal artifacts or IDs, which aligns with the requirements. However, it fails to list all calendar events within the next 7 days as requested. The context shows that there are additional events ('Evening Study' on October 1 and 'Math Review' on October 4) that fall within the specified window (September 29 to October 5, inclusive). The output only mentions 'Assignment Intro' on October 5, omitting other legitimate events from the context, which is a significant shortcoming., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List my calendar events for the next 7 days.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The only calendar event within the next 7 days (October 5–11, 2025) is **"Assignment Intro"** scheduled for **October 5, 2025, at 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM (CET)**.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: Great job!

  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly checked for calendar events in the specified date range and accurately reported that there were none. This fully satisfies the task as requested., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8254235993052588, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context, which states 'Failed to get calendar events,' by indicating that no events were found and the system could not retrieve any events. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor shortcoming is that the actual output is slightly more verbose than the expected output, but all factual content aligns with the context and requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.85, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to view calendar events between October 1 and October 7, 2025. The output clearly states that no events were found in this period, directly addressing the request and confirming task completion. The required tool was called, though the input parameters used 'YYYY-MM-DD' format instead of the expected 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ' format. This is a minor deviation, as the intent and date range were preserved. The response is clear and complete, but the slight mismatch in parameter format prevents a perfect score., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and matches the input language. It appropriately acknowledges the inability to find events in the requested date range, aligning with the context that event retrieval failed. No format or language violations are present., error: None)

For test case:

  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.4136177824166872, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response confirms creation of a calendar event with the correct duration and description, directly addressing the user's request. However, it fails to execute the required first tool call to retrieve the next due assignment from Moodle, instead assuming the assignment details.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.75 because the main request to set up the recurring study block was addressed, but the offer to make further adjustments was not relevant to the specific task, preventing a higher score., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome matches the desired task exactly: a recurring event named 'Evening Study' was created for Tuesdays and Thursdays from 18:00 to 19:30, repeating for 3 weeks (6 occurrences). All specified requirements were met., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.7835456341494857, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the event details from the context: the event is named 'Evening Study', scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM (matching 18:00-19:30), and set to recur for three weeks (6 occurrences). The statement that it is confirmed in the calendar is supported by the context's confirmation of successful creation. The only minor shortcoming is the phrase 'will repeat as specified', which is a general statement but not a hallucination. No unsupported or fabricated information is present, and all required facts from the expected output are included., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6898565802979026, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response clearly confirms that the recurring 'Evening Study' event is scheduled as requested, specifying the correct days, times, and duration. The tool was called to create the event, fulfilling the user's goal. However, there are minor shortcomings: the recurrence rule in the tool call uses 'BYDAY=TW,TH' instead of the correct 'BYDAY=TU,TH', and the event description is missing. These details prevent full alignment with the expected tool parameters, but the main task is otherwise completed., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9999999999999998, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the natural language response is compliant. The output accurately summarizes the requested recurring event, uses user-friendly language, contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and matches the input language. All evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Set a recurring study block every Tue/Thu from 18:00 to 19:30 for the next 3 weeks called "Evening Study".

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The "Evening Study" event is scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM over the next three weeks. It is confirmed in your calendar and will repeat as specified. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
  - expected output: I created a recurring event "Evening Study" on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 18:00 to 19:30 for 3 weeks.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.2857142857142857, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.29 because most of the assignments listed have due dates after the requested cutoff of October 3, 2025, making them irrelevant to the input. The score is not lower because there may be some partial relevance or correct information, but the majority of the output does not address the user's request., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided a list of assignments due before the specified date, fully meeting the requirements of the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All assignments listed in the actual output are directly supported by the context, including their names and due dates. No unsupported claims or hallucinations are present. The factual content matches the expected output, with only minor formatting differences. All required facts are included and correct., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response clearly lists all assignments due before the specified date, directly fulfilling the user's request. The necessary tool was called with a slightly different but functionally equivalent parameter (end of day instead of start), which does not affect the completeness of the result. The output is clear, complete, and confirms task completion. Minor deduction for the small discrepancy in the tool call parameter, but it does not impact the accuracy or relevance of the output., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response follows a clear, user-friendly list format, which is appropriate since no specific format was requested in the input. All assignment names and due dates match the data provided in the context, and no internal data, IDs, or artifacts are present. The language matches the input, and the output is fully compliant with the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List all assignments due before 2025-10-03.
  - actual output: The assignments due before October 3, 2025, are:

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and directly addressed the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused on the user's needs!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly identified the user's most recent past assignment, including its title, due date, and grade, fully achieving the desired task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.7199771655104452, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly identifies 'Safety Equipment Essay' as the most recent past assignment with the due date of September 28, 2025, and the grade of 100, all of which are supported by the context. However, it adds the detail 'for the essay on proper safety equipment usage' as the reason for the grade, which is a minor paraphrase of the assignment introduction in the context ('Write a 500-word essay on proper safety equipment usage'). This is not a hallucination but a slight expansion. All claims are supported by the context, and no unsupported or fabricated information is present. The output also includes the grade, which is not required by the expected output but is present in the context. Overall, the response aligns well with the evaluation steps, with only minor surface differences., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response directly fulfills the user's request by identifying the most recent past assignment, including its name, due date, and grade, which demonstrates completeness. The required tool (moodle-agent.get_assignments_for_all_courses) was called as expected, and the output provides clear confirmation of task completion. There are no signs of vagueness, incompleteness, or missing tool execution., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format or structure, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and accurately references the most recent past assignment ('Safety Equipment Essay' due September 28, 2025) as found in the context. The language matches the input, and no internal IDs or agent/tool names are present. All evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find my most recent past assignment.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The most recent past assignment is **Safety Equipment Essay**, originally due on **September 28, 2025**. It received a grade of **100** for the essay on proper safety equipment usage.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.40 because the output mostly repeats or confirms information without actually fulfilling the input's request to use the assignment's intro as the event description, and includes irrelevant details like a calendar link. However, it does reference the correct event, which is why it is not scored lower., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system created a 90-minute calendar event with a plausible assignment title and correct duration, but the event description was just the assignment title ('Wireframe Design') rather than the assignment's introduction as requested. Additionally, it is not clear if 'Wireframe Design' is actually the next assignment in the course, as no verification is provided., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.2536112430024171, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that a 90-minute calendar event for 'Wireframe Design' was created, with accurate timing and description matching the context. However, it introduces a Google Calendar link, which is present in the context, but claims the event is now 'listed in your calendar and can be accessed via the provided Google Calendar link,' which is not explicitly supported by the context. More critically, the expected output specifies the event should be for the next 'Digital Health UX' assignment with the assignment intro as the description, but the actual output uses 'Wireframe Design' as both the event name and description, missing the required use of the assignment intro. This is a significant factual mismatch with the expected output, resulting in a low score., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6953350318039802, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies the next assignment ('Wireframe Design') in 'Digital Health UX' and creates a 90-minute calendar event at the appropriate time, confirming successful completion. All expected tools were called in the correct order. However, the event description uses only the assignment name ('Wireframe Design') instead of the assignment's intro, which was explicitly requested. This omission makes the output incomplete, resulting in a deduction., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.6618975976415206, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, contains no internal artifacts, and matches the input language. No specific format was requested, so the format is compliant. However, the event description uses only the assignment name ('Wireframe Design') instead of the assignment's introduction ('Create wireframes for a digital health application'), which is available in the context and was explicitly requested in the input. This is a content shortcoming, but not a format violation, so a moderate penalty is applied., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find the next assignment in "Digital Health UX" and create a 90-minute calendar event using its intro as description.
  - actual output: The 90-minute calendar event for "Wireframe Design" has been created successfully. It is scheduled from **October 12, 2025, 9:30 PM** to **October 12, 2025, 11:00 PM** (UTC) with the description "Wireframe Design". The event is now listed in your calendar and can be accessed via the provided Google Calendar link.
  - expected output: I created a 90-minute calendar event for the next "Digital Health UX" assignment with the assignment intro as the description.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.3333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.33 because the response included irrelevant details about the event's date, time, and recurrence, rather than focusing on the requested renaming of the event. However, some information was still related to the event in question, which is why the score is not lower., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome fully achieves the desired task: the user's next 'Math Review' calendar event was renamed to 'Math Deep Dive'. The additional details about the event's schedule and recurrence do not detract from the fact that the renaming was completed as requested., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9982013788162645, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All claims in the actual output are fully supported by the context: the event was renamed from 'Math Review' to 'Math Deep Dive', the date, time, and recurrence details match the context, and there are no hallucinations or unsupported information. The expected output is also satisfied, with no missing required facts., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.7924141812144054, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response clearly confirms that the 'Math Review' event was renamed to 'Math Deep Dive' and provides detailed event information, directly fulfilling the user's request. Both required tool calls were executed: the event was found and then updated. However, the update tool call omitted the 'start' and 'end' fields in its data, which were present in the expected tool call. This is a minor shortcoming, as the main goal was still achieved and confirmed, but the action was not fully aligned with the expected parameters., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and matches the language of the input.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request without any irrelevant statements. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome created a 1.5-hour review session on the due date of the user's most recent past assignment, matching the task requirements exactly. The event is properly titled, scheduled for the correct duration, and references the assignment's due date., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9182425526028812, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context: it schedules a 1.5-hour review session for the 'Safety Equipment Essay' assignment, matches the event title, and confirms the due date as September 28, 2025, all of which are supported by the context and calendar event details. The only minor shortcoming is that the actual output specifies the event time as 9:30 PM to 11:00 PM, which corresponds to the calendar event's start and end times in local time (+02:00), but does not clarify the timezone. Otherwise, all claims are supported, and no hallucinations or unsupported information are present., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response fully aligns with the evaluation steps: the user's goal (scheduling a 1.5-hour review session on the due date of their last past assignment) is clearly identified and directly fulfilled. Both required tool calls (retrieving past assignments and creating a calendar event) were executed with correct parameters. The output confirms successful scheduling, provides event details (title, time, date, and description), and matches the assignment's due date. The response is clear, complete, and demonstrates successful task completion., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8777299866333618, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses clear, natural language and contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts. No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is format compliant. The assignment name and due date are legitimate user-facing data from context. The only minor issue is that the review session is scheduled for 9:30 PM to 11:00 PM on September 28, 2025, which is before the assignment's due time (11:00 PM vs. 11:00 PM due at 11:00 PM), but this does not affect format compliance. The language matches the input, and there are no internal artifacts., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Take my last past assignment and create a 1.5 hour review session on its due date.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: A 1.5-hour review session for your "Safety Equipment Essay" assignment has been scheduled. The event is titled **"Safety Equipment Essay Review Session"** and runs from **9:30 PM to 11:00 PM on September 28, 2025**. The description confirms the assignment’s due date of September 28, 2025. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
  - expected output: I found your last past assignment "{assignment_name}" and created a 1.5 hour review event on {assignment_start_date}.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant, directly addressing the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome fully meets the task requirements by listing all sections and pages for the 'Digital Health UX' course, including details about forums, pages, assignments, and external resources in each section, and noting any exceptions such as the lack of explicit modules in Week 4., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.63315985091915, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists the course sections and correctly identifies the assignments and pages present in the context, such as 'UX Research Report', 'Wireframe Design', and the 'Accessibility Guidelines' page. It also notes that Week 4 lacks explicit modules, which matches the context. However, it introduces some unsupported details, such as the content of the 'Course Syllabus' (e.g., 'includes course overview, key topics, project details, and grading criteria') and the specifics of the 'UX Research Methods' page ('covers qualitative and quantitative methods, with healthcare-specific considerations'), which, while plausible, are not directly stated in the context as summaries. The output does not hallucinate any prizes, money, or fabricated events, but the inclusion of inferred or summarized content not explicitly present in the context prevents a perfect score., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.8377540675801802, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to list all sections and pages for 'Digital Health UX.' The actual output provides a detailed breakdown of the course's sections, including forums, pages, assignments, and external resources, which directly addresses the user's goal. The expected tool calls included both searching for the course and retrieving course details, and these were executed, along with some redundant and unrelated calls (e.g., repeated assignment retrievals and a user info call). The output is clear and mostly complete, but the presence of unnecessary tool calls and a lack of explicit listing for all pages in some sections (e.g., Week 4) slightly detracts from full alignment with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9851952798209368, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is a clear, natural language summary listing all sections and pages for 'Digital Health UX', accurately reflecting the course structure and module names from the context. No internal data, IDs, or artifacts are present, and the language matches the input. The response is user-facing and adheres to all evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List all sections and pages for "Digital Health UX".
  - actual output: The course "Digital Health UX" is divided into five main sections:

1. **General**  
   - Forums: Announcements, Course Announcements, Design Critique Forum, Healthcare UX Resources  
   - Pages: Course Syllabus (includes course overview, key topics, project details, and grading criteria)  
   - URLs: Nielsen Norman Group - Healthcare UX, WCAG 2.1 Guidelines, HHS.gov - HIPAA for Designers, Figma Community - Healthcare Templates  

2. **Week 1: Healthcare UX Research**  
   - Page: UX Research Methods (covers qualitative and quantitative methods, with healthcare-specific considerations)  
   - Assignment: UX Research Report (requires conducting user research and submitting a report)  

3. **Week 2: Accessibility & Compliance**  
   - Page: Accessibility Guidelines (details WCAG 2.1 requirements and healthcare-specific accessibility considerations)  

4. **Week 3: Prototyping & Design Systems**  
   - Assignment: Wireframe Design (students create wireframes for a digital health application)  

5. **Week 4: Usability Testing & Course Project**  
   - No modules listed in the retrieved data.  

The course includes a mix of forums, pages, assignments, and external resources, with a focus on healthcare user experience design, accessibility standards, and HIPAA compliance. The Week 4 section lacks explicit modules, but the overall structure is complete for the other weeks.
  - expected output: Here are the sections and pages for "Digital Health UX": {sections_and_pages}.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.67 because while the main request to add a location was addressed, the output included irrelevant information about accessing the event via a link, which was not asked for. This extra detail detracted from full relevancy, but the core task was still handled., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome exactly matches the desired task: the location 'Library Room B' was added to the user's next 'Evening Study' calendar event.

  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8407150503110673, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that 'Library Room B' was added to the 'Evening Study' event scheduled for 2025-09-29 from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM, which is fully supported by the context. The mention of a link to access the event is also supported, as the context provides an event link. However, the phrase 'has been successfully added to your next' slightly overstates the action, as the context only confirms the event was created with the location, not that a location was added to an existing event. This is a minor discrepancy, but all factual content is present and supported. No hallucinations or unsupported claims are present., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.2777299861174691, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response confirms that the location was added and provides event details, which aligns with the user's goal. However, the tools used do not match the expected sequence: instead of finding and updating the existing event, a new event was created. This is a significant shortcoming, as it may result in duplicate events rather than updating the intended one. The output is otherwise clear and complete, but the incorrect tool usage prevents full credit., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and presents only user-facing information. The event details and location match legitimate data from the context. The language matches the input (English), and there are no violations of the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Add location "Library Room B" to my next "Evening Study".
  - actual output: The location "Library Room B" has been successfully added to your next "Evening Study" event. The event is scheduled for **2025-09-29 at 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM**. A link to access the event is available if needed.
  - expected output: I added the location "Library Room B" to your next "Evening Study".

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.80 because the output mostly addresses the request, but it includes an irrelevant statement about a different time (17:00–18:00) instead of the specified 15:00–16:00, which reduces its accuracy., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome matches the task exactly: a recurring weekly 'Math Review' event is scheduled every Friday from 15:00 to 16:00 for 5 weeks. The time zone is specified, but this does not conflict with the requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8472337798248869, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context: it states that the 'Math Review' event is scheduled weekly on Fridays from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM (UTC+2) starting October 4, 2025, for 5 weeks, which matches the event details in the context (start: 2025-10-04T17:00:00+02:00, end: 2025-10-04T18:00:00+02:00, recurrence: weekly, count: 5, day: Friday). The only minor difference is that the expected output uses 15:00 to 16:00, but the context and actual output both use 17:00 to 18:00 (UTC+2), so the actual output is correct per the context. No hallucinations or unsupported claims are present., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.8924141825201891, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response directly fulfills the user's request by confirming the creation of a weekly 'Math Review' event every Friday from 15:00–16:00 for 5 weeks, starting on the correct date (October 4, 2025). The required tool was called with appropriate parameters, matching the expected recurrence rule and timing. The only minor issue is a slight inconsistency in the time format in the output (mentions 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM instead of 15:00–16:00), but the UTC+2 offset clarifies the intended time. Overall, the output is clear, complete, and confirms successful task completion., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8924141821545698, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and matches the input language (English). No specific format was requested, so the output is format compliant. The only minor issue is the time: the user requested 15:00–16:00, but the output states 17:00–18:00, which is a data accuracy issue, not a format violation. All format-related evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a weekly "Math Review" every Friday 15:00–16:00 for 5 weeks.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The "Math Review" event has been successfully scheduled weekly on Fridays from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM (UTC+2) starting October 4, 2025, for a total of 5 weeks.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request directly without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused on the task!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system did not achieve the desired outcome because it was unable to locate the 'Study Block' event and therefore could not move it 30 minutes later as requested., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the event 'Study Block' could not be found, which is fully supported by the context ('We found 0 calendar events by the free text query: Study Block. No data available'). There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, and the output does not contradict the context. The expected output is not supported by the context, so the actual output is factually accurate and aligns with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.35, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response acknowledges the user's request to move the 'Study Block' event and attempts to find the event using the appropriate tool call. However, it fails to execute the second expected tool call to update the event time, and the output only reports inability to find the event rather than confirming task completion. This results in an incomplete fulfillment of the user's goal and does not demonstrate successful action execution., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the response format is compliant. The output appropriately acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request by explaining that the event could not be found, which aligns with the context indicating no matching calendar events. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or language mismatches present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Move my next "Study Block" event 30 minutes later.
  - actual output: The event "Study Block" could not be found in the calendar system. Please verify the event name or create a new event if needed.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.67 because while the output may have included some relevant information about upcoming assignments, it also contained an offer for further assistance, which is not directly related to the requested digest. This extra, irrelevant statement lowers the score, but the main request was still partially addressed, keeping the score above average., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided a digest of upcoming assignments specifically for the next 10 days, listing both assignments due within that timeframe. The outcome fully aligns with the task requirements., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.6533541346319248, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly lists 'Operations Analysis' and 'PPE Checklist Submission' as upcoming assignments due within the next 10 days, which matches the context data. However, it omits 'Safety Equipment Essay', which is due on 2025-09-28 and also falls within the 10-day window from the context's generation date (2025-09-29). There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, but the omission of a required assignment results in a significant penalty., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.7984156253548687, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response provides a clear and complete digest of upcoming assignments within the requested 10-day window, directly fulfilling the user's request. The necessary tool (moodle-agent.get_assignments_for_all_courses) was called with an appropriate due_before parameter, though the due_after parameter is missing, which could potentially include overdue assignments. The output lists specific assignments with due dates, confirming task completion. Minor deduction for the incomplete tool parameters, but overall strong alignment with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9939913346249355, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the natural language, bulleted list response is fully compliant. The output contains only user-facing assignment names and due dates, all of which are present in the context and within the requested 10-day window. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names. The language matches the input (English). The response is concise and directly addresses the user's request., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6666666666666666, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.67 because the output included an unnecessary statement about September 21, 2025, which is not relevant to identifying what was due last week. However, the main response still addressed the core of the question., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly identified the Safety Equipment Essay as due within the previous week (September 22–28, 2025), but included the UX Research Report, which was due on September 21, just before the specified week. This slightly reduces the score, as not all listed assignments were actually due in the previous week., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.2994899971165275, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output lists 'UX Research Report' as due on September 21 and 'Safety Equipment Essay' as due on September 28, which matches the assignment names and due dates in the context. However, the date range specified in the actual output (September 22–28, 2025) excludes the 'UX Research Report' (due September 21), making its inclusion unsupported. Additionally, the expected output format is not followed. No hallucinated or fabricated information is present, but there is a factual error regarding the date range., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.41301135547181406, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response provides a clear list of assignments and dates, which appears to address the user's request for what was due last week. However, the tool was called with incorrect parameters: it used 'due_before' set to the current week's end instead of the previous week's range as specified in the expected tool call. This means the action may have included assignments outside the requested timeframe, risking incomplete or inaccurate results. The output is otherwise clear and complete, but the misalignment in tool execution is a significant shortcoming., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8374400075800637, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, contains no internal artifacts, and matches the input language. It presents a clear, user-friendly list of assignments due last week, referencing legitimate assignment names and dates from the context. However, it includes the 'UX Research Report' as due on September 21, which is outside the week of September 22–28, 2025, and omits the correct date format for 'Safety Equipment Essay' (should be September 28, 2025). Despite this minor data inaccuracy, the format and structure are compliant, and no format was explicitly requested., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What was due last week?

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The assignments due last week (September 22–28, 2025) were:

  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly identified a specific assignment ('Hello World Program') as the most recent past assignment in the course, including its due date. However, the due date provided is in the future (September 10, 2025), which may indicate a misunderstanding of 'past' versus 'upcoming' assignments.

  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8777299861174692, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response presents the assignments due this week in a clear, user-friendly bulleted list, matching the natural language of the input. No specific format was requested, so the format is compliant. All assignment names and due dates are legitimate data from the context. The only minor issue is that 'Safety Equipment Essay' is listed as due September 28, 2025, which is one day before the current week (starting September 29, 2025), so it should not be included.

The context confirms the recurrence pattern but does not mention any update to the event's duration; both events are still 1.5 hours long in the context.

  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.14677556585279386, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The Actual Output claims that 'Safety Review' events are scheduled for Wednesdays from October 6, 2025, but the context only supports recurring events on Mondays (BYDAY=MO) and a single event on Wednesday, October 6, 2025. The listed dates (October 6, 13, 20, 27) are all Mondays in 2025, not Wednesdays. There is no support in the context for recurring Wednesday events. This is a critical unsupported claim and a factual error, so the response is heavily penalized., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.5668565106437293, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response confirms that 'Safety Review' events were scheduled for four weeks on Wednesdays from 17:00–18:00, listing the correct dates, which aligns with the user's request. However, the tools called include an incorrect recurrence rule (BYDAY=MO) and an event spanning from October 6 to October 27, which does not match the expected weekly Wednesday recurrence.

No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is compliant. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names present. The language matches the input. The only minor issue is that the first event date, October 6, 2025, is a Monday, not a Wednesday, which is a slight data inaccuracy, but this does not affect format compliance., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request perfectly. Great job!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome matches the desired task exactly: a 1-hour kickoff session for 'Intro to Safety' was scheduled at 09:00 on the specified Monday (October 6, 2025)., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.5274096545247293, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states the event name ('Intro to Safety Kickoff'), the scheduled date (October 6, 2025), and the time (9:00 AM), which aligns with the context (event start time is 2025-10-06T11:00:00+02:00, corresponding to 9:00 AM UTC). It also mentions a Google Calendar link, which is supported by the context. However, it omits the event duration (1 hour) and the detail that the event is 'next Monday,' both present in the expected output. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, but the missing required fact (duration) prevents a perfect score., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6130408229511974, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly schedules the event for the right date and time, confirming successful completion of the main user request. However, it only executed the calendar event creation and did not call the expected 'moodle-agent.search_courses_by_name' tool, which was part of the required actions. This omission means not all expected tools were used, resulting in a partial fulfillment of the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.95, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses clear, user-facing language and provides the requested scheduling information in a natural, readable format. No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is format compliant. The date and time are correctly converted to a user-friendly format, and no internal data, IDs, or artifacts are present. The only minor shortcoming is the mention of a 'link to the Google Calendar event' without providing the actual link, but this does not violate any format or content requirements., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a 1-hour kickoff session for "Intro to Safety" next Monday at 09:00.

  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9205537223370767, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that there are no calendar events scheduled for tomorrow, which is fully supported by the context ('We found 0 calendar events. No data available'). There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor difference is the inclusion of the specific date (September 30, 2025), which is not present in the context but is a reasonable inference if the system knows today's date. The required fact from the expected output (no events for tomorrow) is present. Surface differences are minor and do not affect factual accuracy., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to find out what is on their calendar for tomorrow. The output directly answers this by stating there are no events scheduled for September 30, 2025.

  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context, stating that no calendar events were found for 'this weekend' and that the system returned 0 results, which matches the context statement 'We found 0 calendar events by the free text query: this weekend.' There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, and all information is grounded in the context. The expected output is paraphrased but factually aligned, as the event list is none.

  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.3562176500885798, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response addresses the user's request by stating that there are no events for the weekend and provides the relevant date range. However, the tool used was not the expected one; instead of calling the calendar-agent.get_calendar_events with explicit start and end dates, it used a free-text query, which may be less reliable. This misalignment with the expected tool call and the potential for incomplete results reduces the score, despite the output being clear and complete in its negative result., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8197104457497055, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, matches the input language, and does not include internal IDs, agent/tool names, or internal artifacts. No specific format was requested, so the format is compliant. The output appropriately acknowledges the lack of events, referencing the date range. However, it includes a minor system-facing phrase ('using the query "this weekend".

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant and addressed the request for details about the SAFE module without including any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully retrieved and provided detailed information about the SAFE module, including its name, summary, start date, and various status indicators, fully meeting the task requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8229638746215839, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context: it correctly identifies the course name as 'Intro to Safety', the summary as 'Basic safety training', the start date and time, and the course's visibility, completion, favorite, and hidden status. It also correctly notes that the end date is not specified. However, the expected output specifically asks for 'sections and activities', which are not mentioned in the actual output, resulting in a missing required fact. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.4471149305798921, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response provides detailed information about the SAFE module, directly addressing the user's request and demonstrating clear, complete output. However, only the 'search_courses_by_name' tool was called, while the expected sequence also required 'get_course_details' to be executed. This missing tool call is a significant shortcoming, as it may impact the accuracy or completeness of the retrieved details., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9817574482861009, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output presents all relevant course details in clear, natural language, with no internal data, IDs, or artifacts present. All data used (course name, summary, dates, visibility, etc.) is found in the context. The language matches the input (English). There are no violations of the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Get details for the SAFE module.
  - actual output: The SAFE module corresponds to the course "Intro to Safety". This course has a summary stating "Basic safety training" and starts on November 10, 2025, at 10:42 AM UTC. The course is visible, not completed, not favorited, and not hidden. The end date has not been specified.
  - expected output: Here are the sections and activities for "Intro to Safety": {sections_and_activities}.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.00 because the actual output did not address the request to summarize the Python Style Guide; instead, it contained only irrelevant statements unrelated to the summary or content of the guide., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome did not provide any summary of the 'Python Style Guide' as requested. Instead, it stated that no tools or agents were available to perform the task, so the desired outcome was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9146999047217064, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the 'Python Style Guide' is not a course, assignment, or event retrievable by the Moodle or Calendar agents, which is supported by the context describing the agents' capabilities. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor shortcoming is that the expected output assumes a summary is available, but the context does not confirm this. The actual output aligns with the context and evaluation steps, with only a minor difference in not providing a summary., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.12689414330889798, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response fails to attempt the expected tool calls, despite the user's request being to summarize a topic within a course, which could potentially be addressed by searching for the course and retrieving its details. The output is clear about the limitation, but it does not execute any of the expected actions or provide any partial fulfillment of the user's goal. This results in a near-total lack of alignment with the evaluation steps, with only a minimal score for the explicit acknowledgment of inability., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.993991334877404, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the response is format compliant. The output appropriately acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request due to tool limitations, which aligns with the evaluation steps. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or language mismatches present. The response is concise, user-facing, and adheres to all evaluation criteria., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Summarize "Python Style Guide" in "Computer Science Fundamentals".
  - actual output: I cannot answer this question using the available tools/agents. The "Python Style Guide" is not a course, assignment, or calendar event that can be retrieved by the Moodle or Calendar agents. All information must come from tool/agent call results, but no relevant tool exists for this request.
  - expected output: Here is the summary of "Python Style Guide" from Computer Science Fundamentals: {summary}.
  - context: ['The Moodle Agent is a specialized AI assistant for Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) operations.

  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response clearly lists all assignments due in September 2025, directly fulfilling the user's request to show assignments due this month. The correct tool was called with the appropriate date range for the current month, as specified in the expected tools. The output is complete, specific, and confirms successful task completion with no missing or vague information., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the natural language bulleted list in the output is fully compliant. All assignment names and due dates match the context data, and no internal data, IDs, or artifacts are present. The language matches the input (English), and dates are presented in a user-friendly format. There are no violations of the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show assignments due this month.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output was fully relevant and addressed the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The session was scheduled for the correct duration and for the correct assignment, but it was set for the day before the due date rather than on the due date itself as specified in the task. This is a minor deviation, so the alignment is high but not perfect., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.3058264735599503, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that a 2-hour 'Operations Level 2 Prep Session' was scheduled for October 1, 2025, which matches the assignment due date in the context. However, it incorrectly claims the event is from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and that it begins the day before the assignment's due date. The context shows the event is from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM (12:00:00+02:00 to 14:00:00+02:00) on the due date itself, not the day before. These unsupported and inaccurate details reduce the score significantly, but there are no hallucinations or fabricated events., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.4278104056298225, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to create a 2-hour prep session for the next 'Operations Level 2' assignment on its due date. The actual output scheduled the session for October 1, 2025, which is the day before the assignment's due date, not on the due date as requested. While the necessary tools were called, including searching for the course, retrieving assignments, and creating calendar events, the output does not fulfill the explicit request to schedule the session on the due date. Additionally, there are redundant tool calls for the same event, and the confirmation message does not match the user's instructions. This results in a partial and misaligned completion of the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9023275474339076, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input did not specify any required format or structure, so the response is format compliant. The output is in clear, natural language, contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and matches the input language. The only minor shortcoming is that the session is scheduled for 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, while the context shows the actual event was created for 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM (local time). However, this is a data accuracy issue, not a format violation, so only a minimal penalty is warranted., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a 2-hour prep session for the next "Operations Level 2" assignment on its due date.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: A 2-hour "Operations Level 2 Prep Session" has been scheduled for **October 1, 2025**, from **10:00 AM to 12:00 PM**. The event is set to begin the day before the assignment's due date. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the input perfectly. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly identified the next 'Evening Study' event and updated its description to include 'Bring OSHA Quick Card' as requested, fully achieving the desired task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8238364709729755, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the next 'Evening Study' event was updated to include 'Bring OSHA Quick Card' in its description, which is supported by the context. It also provides the event's date, time, and location (September 29, 2025, 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM, Library Room B), all of which are present in the context. The only minor issue is that the expected output does not mention the event's date, time, or location, but including these details is not a hallucination since they are supported by the context. No unsupported or fabricated information is present, and all required facts are included. The output slightly exceeds the expected output in detail, but this is acceptable per the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.3926991050046381, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response claims the event description was updated as requested and provides specific event details, which aligns with the user's goal. However, the tool call for updating the event only changed the summary to 'Bring OSHA Quick Card' instead of appending it to the description as required. Additionally, the update did not preserve the original description or include the event's start and end times as expected. This partial execution and mismatch with the expected tool parameters reduce alignment with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8584223506985558, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal artifacts, and matches the input language. It accurately reflects the update to the next 'Evening Study' event, referencing the correct date and location from the context. The only minor shortcoming is that the event's summary appears to have been changed to 'Bring OSHA Quick Card' in the context, but the output describes it as an addition to the description, which could be slightly misleading. However, this does not constitute a format violation., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find my next "Evening Study" and add "Bring OSHA Quick Card" to its description.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The next "Evening Study" event has been updated to include "Bring OSHA Quick Card" in its description. The event is scheduled for September 29, 2025, from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM in Library Room B.
  - expected output: I found your next "Evening Study" and added "Bring OSHA Quick Card" to its description.

  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.1, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to summarize the 'Final Exam Study Guide' from 'Intro to Safety'. The actual output fails to fulfill this goal, providing only an explanation of missing data and inability to proceed.

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5714285714285714, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.57 because while the response may have addressed finding the 'SAFE' module, it included irrelevant details about the course end date, favorite status, and hidden status, which do not help answer the specific request.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.00 because none of the statements in the output actually list the side blocks as requested; instead, they describe sections and activities unrelated to the specific question about side blocks., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided a detailed list of side blocks in the 'Intro to Safety' course, including sections and their contents. However, the inclusion of detailed contents under each section may go beyond just listing the side blocks, which could be interpreted as a more concise list of block names. Still, the main task of listing the side blocks was achieved., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.7014930280554184, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists the side blocks and their organization for the 'Intro to Safety' course, matching the section and module titles found in the context. All items mentioned (e.g., Announcements, Course Syllabus, Hazard Types Overview, Safety Quiz 1, etc.) are present in the context. However, the output omits some modules that are present in the context, such as 'OSHA Safety Standards' and 'Safety Training Videos' in the General section, which are required for full alignment with the expected output. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, but the omission of these modules prevents a perfect score., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to list the side blocks in 'Intro to Safety'. The actual output provides a clear, organized list of all side blocks by section, directly fulfilling the user's goal. Both expected tool calls (searching for the course and retrieving its details) were executed as required. The response is complete, specific, and confirms successful task completion with no missing or vague information., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9182425530473723, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response presents a clear, user-friendly list of course sections and their modules for 'Intro to Safety', matching the structure and content found in the context. No specific format was requested in the input, so the natural language and bulleted/numbered format is compliant. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names present. The only minor shortcoming is that the term 'side blocks' is interpreted as course sections/modules, which is reasonable given the context, but could be more explicitly clarified., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List the side blocks in "Intro to Safety".
  - actual output: The side blocks in "Intro to Safety" are organized as follows:  

1. **General Section**:  
   - Announcements (Forum)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.50 because while the output included some relevant information about the syllabus, it also contained several irrelevant details such as the course start date, completion status, and platform activity, which do not pertain to summarizing the syllabus content. This extra information reduced the overall relevancy of the answer., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided a very high-level summary mentioning the course's general focus, start date, and status, but did not summarize any specific content, sections, or activities from the syllabus. A proper summary should include the main topics, structure, and key activities outlined in the syllabus., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.7093860531473313, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately summarizes the course syllabus, start date, and completion status, all of which are supported by the context. It correctly states the course is active and not completed. However, the claim that 'the syllabus provides an overview of the course focus but does not include detailed sections or activities' is not directly supported by the context, as there is no information about the presence or absence of detailed sections or activities. This unsupported inference slightly reduces the score, but there are no hallucinations or critical errors., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.40193536758023357, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to summarize the 'Course Syllabus' page for 'Advanced Mathematics.' The output provides a brief summary and some course details, partially addressing the request. However, only the first expected tool (search_courses_by_name) was called, and the crucial second tool (get_course_details) was not executed, likely resulting in a vague and incomplete summary. The response lacks detailed syllabus content and does not fully confirm task completion as expected., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8962673116671761, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response summarizes the 'Course Syllabus' for 'Advanced Mathematics' using only information present in the context, such as the summary text and the course start date. The date is presented in a user-friendly format, and no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names are included. The output is in natural language and matches the input language (English). The only minor shortcoming is the inclusion of the exact time and UTC label, which is slightly more technical than necessary, but this does not constitute a major format violation., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Summarize the "Course Syllabus" page from "Advanced Mathematics".
  - actual output: The "Course Syllabus" for "Advanced Mathematics" is summarized as: "Complex mathematical concepts and applications." The course begins on November 10, 2025, at 10:42 AM UTC and has not been marked as completed. The syllabus provides an overview of the course focus but does not include detailed sections or activities. The course is active in the learning platform.
  - expected output: Here is the summary of "Course Syllabus" from Advanced Mathematics: {summary}.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant and addressed the question directly without any irrelevant information. Great job!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome fully informs the user about the Moodle Agent's capabilities, listing its main functions such as retrieving courses, searching, inspecting contents, viewing assignments, and accessing user information. This directly aligns with the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.6835181008017883, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The Actual Output accurately describes the Moodle Agent's ability to retrieve enrolled courses, search for courses, inspect course contents, view assignments with date filtering, and access user information, all of which are supported by the context. However, it omits the ability to create or update calendar events, which is present in the Expected Output and supported by the context (though this is more directly associated with the Calendar Agent, the Expected Output includes it as a Moodle Agent function). There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, but the omission of calendar event management results in a deduction., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response directly addresses the user's question by clearly listing the specific actions the Moodle Agent can perform, such as retrieving courses, searching, inspecting contents, viewing assignments, and accessing user information. The answer is complete, specific, and aligns with the user's request for capabilities. No tool calls were expected or required, and none were made., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9437823499114202, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, matches the input language (English), and does not include any internal data, IDs, or artifacts. No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is format compliant. The response accurately summarizes the Moodle Agent's capabilities as described in the context, though it does refer to itself as 'The Moodle Agent' rather than 'I', which is a minor stylistic issue but not a format violation., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.60 because while the output partially addresses the request, it includes irrelevant details such as the event end time and a link to manage the event, which do not directly help with finding the session or adding the location. These extra details reduce the overall relevancy of the answer., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly identified the next 'Digital Health UX' session and added the specified location 'Design Lab 2' to it, fully achieving the desired task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.7881173259114125, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context by stating the session name, location, date, time, and calendar link, all of which are present in the context. The only minor issue is the use of 'CEST' for the time zone, while the context provides the time as '+02:00' without explicitly stating 'CEST'. However, this is a reasonable interpretation and not a factual error. All claims are supported by the context, and no hallucinations or unsupported information are present. The output also includes all required facts from the expected output., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.27772998663336157, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to find their next 'Digital Health UX' session and update its location to 'Design Lab 2'. The expected tool calls were to search for the existing event and update it, not to create a new one. The actual output confirms the event is scheduled with the correct location and time, but the tool used was 'create_calendar_event' instead of the required 'find' and 'update' sequence. This means the user's request was not properly fulfilled, as it may have resulted in a duplicate event rather than updating the existing one. The response is clear and complete in its confirmation, but the incorrect tool usage is a significant shortcoming., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and presents the event details in a user-friendly way. The event data and link are legitimate, as they appear in the context. The language matches the input, and there are no violations of the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find my next "Digital Health UX" session and add the location "Design Lab 2".

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The "Digital Health UX" session has been scheduled in "Design Lab 2" and is confirmed in the calendar. The event is scheduled for **October 22, 2025, at 3:00 PM CEST** and will end at **4:00 PM CEST**.

  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.48990490311860374, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output claims that the user is free next Thursday between 14:00 and 16:00 and that a calendar check showed no scheduled events. The context confirms that there are 0 calendar events and no data available, supporting the claim of no scheduled events. However, the actual output asserts a calendar check was performed, which is not explicitly supported by the context, and the phrasing does not match the expected output's format. While the factual content is mostly correct, the output makes a minor unsupported claim about a calendar check, warranting a significant but not total penalty., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to determine their availability next Thursday between 14:00 and 16:00.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.50 because while the answer included some information, it also contained irrelevant details about course content and start dates, which did not address the specific request for external links. The score is not lower because at least part of the response was related to the course in question., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.1, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome did not provide any external links as requested in the task. It only returned the course summary and start date, which are not external resources. There is a minimal score because some information about the course was provided, but the main requirement was not met., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.95, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately states that no external links or URLs were found for 'Computer Science Fundamentals,' which is fully supported by the context. It correctly summarizes the course details (summary and start date) as provided in the context and does not introduce any unsupported or fabricated information. The only minor issue is that the expected output format references '{urls}', but since no URLs exist in the context, the actual output's approach is reasonable. There are no hallucinations or contradictions., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.4082241974443145, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to show external links for the course 'Computer Science Fundamentals.' The output clearly states that no external links were found, which directly addresses the user's request. However, only the first expected tool (search_courses_by_name) was called, and the second expected tool (get_course_details) was not executed. This is a shortcoming, as the second tool might have provided more detailed information or confirmed the absence of external links. The response is clear and complete in its explanation, but the incomplete tool execution prevents a higher score., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and accurately acknowledges the lack of external links for the course, referencing only user-facing data from the context. The language matches the input, and there are no violations of the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show external links for "Computer Science Fundamentals".
  - actual output: No external links were found for "Computer Science Fundamentals" in the available data.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and directly addressed the request for external links related to 'Advanced Mathematics'. Great job staying focused!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome did not provide any external links for 'Advanced Mathematics', which was the core requirement of the task. The explanation given was about a limitation, but the task itself was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8911382502623197, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that neither the moodle-agent nor the calendar-agent provides external links for 'Advanced Mathematics', which is supported by the context describing their capabilities. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor shortcoming is that the expected output lists external links, but the context does not indicate that such links are available, so the actual output's refusal is justified. The response aligns well with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.18807970858005138, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies that the available agents are limited in scope, but it fails to attempt the expected tool calls (search_courses_by_name and get_course_details) that could potentially retrieve external links if present in course details. The output does not attempt to fulfill the user's request or provide any result, and no tool calls were executed as required. The explanation is clear but does not demonstrate any effort to complete the task using the available tools., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8880797079542407, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly acknowledges its inability to fulfill the request for external links, citing the limitations of the available agents as described in the context. No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the format is compliant. The output contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and matches the input language. The only minor issue is the mention of agent names, but this is justified as it directly explains the limitation based on context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show external links for "Advanced Mathematics".
  - actual output: I cannot show external links for "Advanced Mathematics" as this request falls outside the domain of both available agents (moodle-agent and calendar-agent). These tools are designed for academic content retrieval and scheduling management, not for providing external links. All information must come from tool/agent call results.
  - expected output: External links in "Advanced Mathematics": {urls}.

  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8274201522817435, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All assignments and events listed in the Actual Output are directly supported by the Context, with correct names and due dates/times. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor issue is that the Actual Output does not use the exact phrasing of the Expected Output, but this is a surface-level difference and does not affect factual accuracy. All required facts are present and correct., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to retrieve this week's assignments and calendar schedule.

  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9970687772110528, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output presents assignments and calendar events in clear, user-friendly natural language, with no internal data, IDs, or artifacts present. All event and assignment names and dates are legitimate user-facing data from the context. The language matches the input (English).

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.55, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.55 because much of the output included irrelevant information such as resource lists, assignment details, and content descriptions, rather than directly listing the pages and forums as requested. However, some relevant information was present, which is why the score is not lower., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system fully achieved the task by listing all pages and forums in the 'Intro to Safety' course, including specific examples of both forums and pages as requested., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.2668885547551098, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output includes some correct information, such as the names of sections, pages, and forums, which are supported by the context. However, it introduces unsupported details: 'Safety Quiz 1' is a forum in the output but is an assignment in the context, and its due date is fabricated. The '500-word essay on PPE usage' and 'PPE inspection checklist submission' are described as assignments, but the output invents their exact format and combines them, while the context lists them as separate assignments with specific names. The 'Final Exam Study Guide' is listed as both a page and a resource, but the context only lists it as a page. These inaccuracies and fabrications mean the output contains mixed correct and hallucinated content, warranting a low score., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to see the pages and forums in the 'Intro to Safety' course. The actual output provides a clear, organized list of all relevant pages and forums, grouped by course section, directly fulfilling the request. Both expected tool calls (searching for the course and retrieving its details) were executed as required. The response is complete, specific, and confirms successful task completion with no missing or vague information., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.901098694354139, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, user-facing format, and matches the language of the input (English). No specific format (e.g., Markdown, JSON, bulleted list) was explicitly requested, so the use of a bulleted/sectioned list is compliant. The output does not include any internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and all course names and section titles are present in the context. The only minor issue is that 'Safety Quiz 1' is listed as a forum, when in the context it is an assignment, but this is a data accuracy issue, not a format violation, so it does not affect the format score., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show me the pages and forums in "Intro to Safety".
  - actual output: The course "Intro to Safety" includes the following pages and forums:

- **General Section**:
  - Forums: Announcements, Course Announcements, General Discussion
  - Page: Course Syllabus (contains course description, learning objectives, materials, and grading criteria)
  - Resources: OSHA Safety Standards, Safety Training Videos

- **Week 1: Workplace Hazard Identification**:
  - Page: Hazard Types Overview (explains physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, and psychosocial hazards)
  - Forum: Safety Quiz 1 (due November 10, 2025 at 10:40 AM UTC)

- **Week 2: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**:
  - Forum: Safety Incident Reports
  - Page: Emergency Procedures (guidelines for fire, medical, and chemical spill responses)
  - Assignments: 500-word essay on PPE usage, PPE inspection checklist submission

- **Week 3: Emergency Response & Final Assessment**:
  - Page: Final Exam Study Guide (topics, exam format, study tips)
  - Resource: Final Exam Study Guide (preparation materials)
  - expected output: Here are the pages and forums in "Intro to Safety": {pages_and_forums}.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the input perfectly. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.7, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The task was to find the user's next calendar event titled 'Evening Study' and change its title to 'Safety Study'. The actual outcome changed the first (next) 'Evening Study' event as required, but did not address the second event. Since the task only specified changing the next event, the outcome aligns with the task, but the mention of a second event not being changed suggests there may be ambiguity if multiple events occur at the same time. Overall, the main requirement was met, but the handling of recurring or multiple events could be clearer., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.6877427346897175, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly states that the first 'Evening Study' event was renamed to 'Safety Study' and provides accurate details about its schedule and recurrence, all of which are supported by the context. It also correctly notes that the second event remains unchanged. However, the Expected Output only requires confirmation of the renaming, not the extra event details. While the additional information is accurate and not hallucinated, it is unnecessary and could be considered minor over-specification. No unsupported or fabricated claims are present, so only a minor penalty is warranted., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.832082129433083, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies and fulfills the user's request to find the next 'Evening Study' event and rename it to 'Safety Study.' The output provides confirmation, including the event's date, time, and recurrence details, demonstrating clear task completion. Both required tool calls were executed: searching for the event and updating its title. However, the update tool call omitted the 'start' and 'end' fields in its data, which were present in the expected tool call parameters. This is a minor shortcoming, as the main goal was still achieved and clearly communicated., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the natural language response is compliant. The output clearly states that the first 'Evening Study' event was renamed to 'Safety Study' and provides accurate scheduling details, matching the context data. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or non-user-facing data present, and the language matches the input. The response fully aligns with the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find my next "Evening Study" and change the title to "Safety Study".

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The first "Evening Study" event has been renamed to "Safety Study". It is scheduled for October 1, 2025, from 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM CET, recurring weekly on Tuesday and Thursday for 6 weeks. The second "Evening Study" event remains unchanged.
  - expected output: I found your upcoming event and renamed it to "Safety Study".

  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.3, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome scheduled a 1-hour study slot, but only for one day and one assignment. The task required creating a 1-hour study slot on each day an assignment is due this week, which implies multiple slots if there are multiple due dates. The outcome partially fulfills the task but is incomplete., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.6677449637390451, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately describes the creation of a 1-hour study slot titled 'Study Slot for Operations Analysis and PPE Checklist Submission' on October 1, 2025, from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM CET, which is fully supported by the context. The mention of the event being confirmed and accessible via the provided calendar link is also supported by the context. However, the expected output specifies that 1-hour study events were created for each assignment due day this week, and the context shows there are two assignments due on the same day, but only one event was created. Thus, the actual output omits the detail that multiple events should have been created if there were multiple due days, but in this case, both assignments share the same due date and are combined into one event. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, but the output does not explicitly clarify that both assignments are covered by the single event, which is a minor shortcoming., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6251073480712213, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to create a 1-hour study slot on each day an assignment is due this week. The tools called match the expected tools, retrieving assignments and creating a calendar event. However, the actual output only confirms the creation of a single study slot for one assignment due on October 1, 2025, rather than for each day an assignment is due. This indicates partial fulfillment of the request. The response is clear and confirms event creation, but it is incomplete as it does not address all possible assignment due dates within the week., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9437823499114202, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and matches the language of the input. No specific format was requested, so the output is compliant. The event title accurately combines both assignment names due on the same day, and the date and time are presented in a user-friendly format. The only minor shortcoming is the mention of a 'provided calendar link' without including the actual link, but this does not violate any format or content requirements., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a 1-hour study slot on each day an assignment is due this week.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: A 1-hour study slot titled "Study Slot for Operations Analysis and PPE Checklist Submission" has been scheduled for October 1, 2025, from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM CET. The event is confirmed and accessible via the provided calendar link.

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.75 because while the main request was addressed, there was a generic offer of help included that did not specifically relate to creating or scheduling the session.

  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system scheduled a 45-minute calendar session with the correct title and time, but it set the date to October 1, 2025, instead of 'tomorrow' as requested. The main discrepancy is the date, which may or may not match the intended 'tomorrow' depending on when the task was issued., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.1851952807606726, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output contains some correct information: it references the correct session title, date (October 1, 2025), and duration (45 minutes), which are supported by the context. However, it introduces unsupported details: the time is stated as 6:00 PM CEST, while the context shows the event is at 20:00 (8:00 PM) CEST, and the phrase 'available in your calendar' is not explicitly supported. The offer for further assistance is not in the context or expected output. The time discrepancy is a factual error, and the extra details are unsupported, so the score is heavily penalized., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6918605025106437, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response confirms that a session titled 'Hazard Types Overview' was scheduled for the correct date and time, matching the user's request for a 45-minute session tomorrow at 18:00. The tool call was executed, but the event name did not include the 'Read:' prefix and lacked the event description as specified in the expected tool call. Additionally, the tool was called twice unnecessarily. Despite these minor discrepancies, the main goal was fulfilled and the user received clear confirmation., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9437823499114201, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses clear, natural language and contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts. It matches the input language (English) and provides all requested details: session title, date (correctly interpreted as October 1, 2025, which is 'tomorrow' from the current date), time (6:00 PM CEST), and duration (45 minutes). There was no explicit format requested in the input, so the natural language format is compliant. The only minor issue is a slight ambiguity in the time: the context event is scheduled for 20:00 (8:00 PM), but the output says 6:00 PM. This is a minor factual mismatch, but does not violate format requirements, so only a small deduction is warranted., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a 45-minute session to read "Hazard Types Overview" tomorrow at 18:00.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The session titled "Hazard Types Overview" has been scheduled for tomorrow (October 1, 2025) at 6:00 PM CEST. It will last 45 minutes and is available in your calendar. Let me know if you need further assistance!
  - expected output: I created a 45-minute reading session for "Hazard Types Overview" tomorrow at 18:00.
