Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant and directly addressed your question without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system not only confirmed the existence of the course 'Digital Health UX' for the user, as requested, but also provided additional relevant information such as the course summary and start date. This fully satisfies the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8805492954108166, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately states the course name, summary, and start date, all of which are present in the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor issue is the omission of some course fields (e.g., Course ID, visibility, completion status) that are present in the context and implied by the expected output's placeholder for partial information, but the provided facts are correct and supported. Surface differences are minimal and acceptable., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response directly answers the user's question by confirming the existence of the course 'Digital Health UX' and provides additional relevant details such as the course summary and start date. The required tool 'moodle-agent.search_courses_by_name' was correctly called with the appropriate parameters, fully aligning with the evaluation steps and demonstrating successful completion of the user's goal., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9047425871999494, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly confirms the existence of the course 'Digital Health UX', provides the summary, and gives the start date in a user-friendly format. No specific format was requested in the input, so the natural language response is compliant. The data used (course name, summary, start date) is present in the context and is legitimate. The only minor issue is the inclusion of the exact time (10:42:03 AM), which, while user-friendly, could be considered overly precise, but it is not in ISO format and does not violate the requirements. No internal artifacts or IDs are present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Do I have a course called "Digital Health UX"?
  - actual output: Yes, you have a course called "Digital Health UX". The course summary is "Advanced digital health user experience design" and it starts on November 10, 2025 at 10:42:03 AM.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: Great job! The score is 1.00 because all information provided was directly relevant to showing your Moodle profile basics, with no irrelevant statements included., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system only displayed the user's name, which is a basic part of the Moodle profile, but did not provide other basic information such as email or enrolled courses. Therefore, the outcome only partially fulfills the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.2561813257967567, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly provides the user's name as 'Sabrina Studentin', which is supported by the context. However, it incorrectly claims that email and enrolled courses are 'not available through current tools', despite the context indicating that the agent can access enrolled courses and user information. The expected output also requires both first and last names to be explicitly mentioned, which is only partially met. No hallucinated or fabricated information is present, but the output omits required facts and makes unsupported claims about tool limitations., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6383304068090883, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies the user's request to show Moodle profile basics and calls the expected tool (moodle-agent.get_user_info). However, the output provides only the user's name and states that email and enrolled courses are not available, which suggests incomplete retrieval of profile basics. The response is clear but lacks the expected details or confirmation of full task completion, resulting in a partial fulfillment of the user's goal., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8938139447859799, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output presents user-facing information in natural language, with no internal data, IDs, or artifacts. The name 'Sabrina Studentin' is legitimate, as it appears in CONTEXT. The response appropriately acknowledges limitations regarding unavailable email and course data. The only minor shortcoming is that the name could have been split into first and last names as in CONTEXT, but this does not constitute a format violation., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show my Moodle profile basics.
  - actual output: Your Moodle profile basics include:  
- **Name**: Sabrina Studentin  
- **Email**: Not available through current tools  
- **Enrolled Courses**: Not available through current tools

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant and addressed the question directly with no irrelevant information. Great job!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system identified two URLs linked in the course, which likely covers the main requirement. However, without confirmation that these are all the URLs present in the course, there is a small chance some were missed, so a perfect score is not given., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0000000000000002, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output lists the two URLs ('OSHA Safety Standards' and 'Safety Training Videos') that are present in the context under the course contents for 'Intro to Safety'.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.80 because the output repeats the course name without providing the requested assignment information, which is somewhat relevant but does not fully address the user's request., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly identified the course and provided the assignment name, due date, and instructions, fully meeting the task requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9038640709610238, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists the assignment 'Operations Analysis' for 'Operations Level 2' and provides the correct due date (October 1, 2025), both of which are supported by the context. The brief description 'Submit an analysis of the provided operational scenario' is a paraphrase of the assignment introduction in the context and does not introduce unsupported information. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor issue is that the output does not exactly match the expected output's format, but this is a surface difference and does not affect factual correctness., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to show assignments for 'Operations Level 2'. The actual output directly fulfills this by listing the assignment name, due date, and a brief description. Both expected tool calls were executed as required to retrieve the course and its assignments. The response is clear, complete, and confirms successful completion of the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format was requested in the input, so the natural language response is compliant. The output accurately lists the assignment for 'Operations Level 2' using user-friendly language and date formatting, with no internal data, IDs, or artifacts present. All assignment details are supported by the context, and the language matches the input., error: None)

No specific format was requested in the input, so the bulleted list is compliant. The language matches the input (English), and there are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names present. The only minor issue is the use of 'November 10, 2025 at 10:42 AM UTC' for the start date, which, while user-friendly, includes 'UTC' (a technical timezone label), but this is a negligible infraction. Overall, the output strongly aligns with the evaluation steps., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the summary focused directly on the 'Course Syllabus' in Digital Health UX without including any irrelevant information. Great job staying on topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome provides a clear and comprehensive summary of the 'Digital Health UX' course syllabus, covering both the structure (general sections and weekly modules) and the main themes and focus areas of the course. This fully aligns with the task of summarizing the syllabus., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.37568298032091835, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response accurately lists the forums, syllabus topics, and external resources, which are supported by the context. It also correctly summarizes the course's focus on user-centered design, research, and accessibility. However, it introduces unsupported details: specific assignment due dates (October 12, November 3) and claims that Week 4 has 'no listed modules' (the context shows Week 4 is 'Usability Testing & Course Project'). These inaccuracies are not present in the context and contradict the provided data, resulting in a significant penalty., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to summarize the 'Course Syllabus' for Digital Health UX.

  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.903732689136002, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response provides a clear, well-structured summary of the 'Course Syllabus' for Digital Health UX, using natural language and a bulleted/sectioned format that is user-friendly. No specific format was requested in the input, so the chosen structure is compliant. The summary accurately reflects key details from the context, such as course topics (research, accessibility, design systems), project and grading structure, and relevant resources. No internal data, IDs, or artifacts are present. The only minor shortcoming is that some details (e.g., specific grading percentages, team size for the project) could have been included for completeness, but this does not constitute a format violation., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Summarize "Course Syllabus" in Digital Health UX.
  - actual output: The "Digital Health UX" course includes the following key components:  

**General Section**

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and directly addressed the input without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly listed all assignments due before 2025-10-03, including their names and due dates, fully satisfying the task requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All assignments listed in the actual output are directly supported by the context, which provides a table of 7 assignments due before 2025-10-03. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, and the factual content matches the expected output. Minor formatting differences are acceptable per the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response clearly lists all assignments due before the specified date, directly fulfilling the user's request. The necessary tool was called with a slightly different but functionally equivalent parameter (end of day instead of start), which does not affect the completeness or accuracy of the result. The output is specific, complete, and confirms task completion. Minor deduction is given for the small discrepancy in the tool call parameter, but it does not impact the outcome., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response lists all assignments due before 2025-10-03, matching the data in CONTEXT. No specific format was requested in the input, so the use of a bulleted list is compliant. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names present. The language matches the input, and all assignment names and dates are legitimate user-facing data from CONTEXT. The output is clear, user-friendly, and fully aligns with the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List all assignments due before 2025-10-03.
  - actual output: The assignments due before 2025-10-03 are:  
- **UX Research Report** due 2025-09-21  
- **Hello World Program** due 2025-09-10

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant, directly addressing the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome fully meets the task requirements by providing a detailed list of all sections and pages for the 'Digital Health UX' course, including both general and weekly sections as well as their respective contents., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.5607754973213229, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists the main sections and pages of the 'Digital Health UX' course, matching the context: General section with forums and syllabus, and weekly sections with correct topics and assignments. However, it introduces minor unsupported details, such as 'project requirements' and 'grading breakdown' in the syllabus, and groups external resources under 'External Resources' rather than listing them as individual URLs. These are slight extrapolations but not major hallucinations. All required facts from the expected output are present, and there are no fabricated modules, assignments, or financial information. The output is mostly aligned with the context, with only minor unsupported claims., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9939913345618183, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to list all sections and pages for the 'Digital Health UX' course. The actual output provides a clear, organized breakdown of all sections and their respective pages, assignments, and resources, directly fulfilling the user's goal. Both expected tool calls (searching for the course and retrieving its details) were executed as required. The response is complete, specific, and confirms successful task completion with no missing or vague information., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8330807047145509, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response provides a clear, user-friendly listing of sections and pages for 'Digital Health UX', matching the input request. The format is natural language with bulleted and numbered lists, which is appropriate since no specific format was required. All data presented is legitimate and derived from the context, with no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names. However, some details are generalized (e.g., 'Syllabus: Overview, key topics, project requirements, grading breakdown' instead of the full syllabus content from context), and some module names are paraphrased or grouped (e.g., 'External Resources' instead of listing each resource by name). While this does not violate format requirements, it slightly reduces completeness and fidelity to the context, warranting a minor deduction., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List all sections and pages for "Digital Health UX".
  - actual output: The "Digital Health UX" course includes the following sections and pages:  

1. **General Section**  
   - Forums: Announcements, Course Announcements, Design Critique Forum, Healthcare UX Resources  
   - Syllabus: Overview, key topics, project requirements, grading breakdown  
   - External Resources: Nielsen Norman Group, WCAG guidelines, Figma templates  

2. **Weekly Sections**  
   - **Week 1: Healthcare UX Research**  
     - Page: Research methods  
     - Assignment: Research report  
   - **Week 2: Accessibility & Compliance**  
     - Page: WCAG standards, HIPAA compliance  
   - **Week 3: Prototyping & Design Systems**  
     - Assignment: Wireframe design  
   - **Week 4: Usability Testing & Course Project**  
     - No modules listed  

All content is organized under the course’s structure.
  - expected output: Here are the sections and pages for "Digital Health UX": {sections_and_pages}.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant to the input with no irrelevant statements. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully identified the correct course and provided comprehensive details, including description, learning outcomes, grading structure, module breakdown, and additional resources, fully meeting the requirements of the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.7553032385580859, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately summarizes the course description, learning outcomes, grading breakdown, and lists the six modules, all of which are supported by the context. It also correctly mentions additional resources like the Python style guide, debugging tips, official documentation, and GitHub repository, which are present in the context. However, the actual output slightly overgeneralizes some module content (e.g., does not specify the exact topics for each week as detailed in the context) and omits mention of specific assignments (like 'Hello World Program' and 'Data Structures Project') that are present in the context. Despite these minor omissions, there are no hallucinations or unsupported claims., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9095349464899108, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to search for 'Computer Science Fundamentals'. The actual output provides a comprehensive overview of the course, including its content, structure, grading, and resources, which directly fulfills the user's request. The expected tool call (search_courses_by_name) was executed, and an additional relevant tool (get_course_details) was also called to provide detailed information. The response is clear and complete, demonstrating successful goal completion. A minor deduction is warranted because the output does not explicitly confirm the search action or present a list of matching courses, but instead assumes a single match and provides details., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the response format is compliant. The actual output provides a clear, natural language summary of the course, accurately reflecting details from the context such as course description, learning outcomes, grading breakdown, weekly modules, and additional resources. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or non-user-facing data present. The language matches the input, and all information is legitimate and user-facing., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Search for "Computer Science Fundamentals".
  - actual output: The course "Computer Science Fundamentals" is an introduction to computer science through Python programming. It covers topics like variables, control structures, functions, recursion, object-oriented programming, and data structures.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the input perfectly. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system failed to find any past assignments, which was the core requirement of the task. Only an upcoming assignment was identified, so the actual outcome does not achieve the desired task at all., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.12095473081143626, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output incorrectly claims that no past assignments are available, despite the context listing multiple assignments with due dates before the current date (e.g., 'UX Research Report' due 2025-09-21). This contradicts the context and omits required information from the expected output. No hallucinations are present, but the answer is factually incorrect and unsupported., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.7628545599106165, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies the user's goal to find the most recent past assignment and confirms that the necessary tool was called with the appropriate parameter (due_before today). The output clearly states that no past assignments were found and provides information about the next upcoming assignment. However, the mention of the upcoming assignment is not strictly necessary, and the response could be more concise by focusing solely on the absence of past assignments. Overall, the output is clear, complete, and directly addresses the user's request., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.30230193506080966, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language and does not include internal artifacts or IDs, aligning with format requirements. However, it incorrectly claims that no past assignments are available, despite the context listing several assignments with due dates before the current date (e.g., 'UX Research Report' due 2025-09-21 and 'Safety Equipment Essay' due 2025-09-28). This shows a failure to use legitimate data from context, but since the evaluation is focused on format and not content accuracy, the main deduction is for not leveraging available context data, not for format violations., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find my most recent past assignment.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The most recent past assignment is not available in the provided data. The system only identified the upcoming assignment "Data Structures Project" with a due date of October 27, 2025. No past assignments were retrieved in the latest analysis.
  - expected output: Your most recent past assignment is {assignment_name} with due date {due_date}.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and directly addressed the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully performed the requested task by searching for calendar events within the specified date range and accurately reported that there were no events found. The outcome fully aligns with the task, as the absence of events is a valid and complete result., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context, stating that no calendar events were found between October 1, 2025, and October 7, 2025, and referencing '0 calendar events' and 'No data available,' both of which are present in the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, and all required facts from the expected output are included, albeit with minor paraphrasing., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.32689414213699947, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response clearly states that no calendar events were found for the requested date range, directly addressing the user's request. However, the wrong tool was used: instead of 'calendar-agent.get_calendar_events' with explicit start and end dates, 'calendar-agent.find_calendar_events_by_free_text_query' was called with a less precise query. This misalignment with the expected tool call reduces confidence in the completeness and accuracy of the result, warranting a significant penalty., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response format is compliant. The actual output is in natural language, matches the input language, and contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts. The response accurately reflects the context, which confirms that there are no calendar events for the specified date range. All evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

For test case:

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output was fully relevant and addressed the input perfectly. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome matches the desired task exactly: a recurring event named 'Evening Study' is scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 18:00 to 19:30 for the specified duration of 3 weeks. All requirements are met., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8807628547430987, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context: it states that a recurring event titled 'Evening Study' is scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM, starting September 30 and ending October 16, which matches the event details in the context. The output does not introduce any unsupported claims or hallucinations. The only minor issue is the phrase 'will occur weekly as planned,' which is a slight paraphrase but still supported by the recurrence rule in the context. All required facts from the expected output are present., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.7731058566911021, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The output confirms that a recurring event titled 'Evening Study' was scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays from 18:00 to 19:30, matching the user's request for the next 3 weeks. The tool call was executed, and the event details (start date, end date, recurrence) align closely with the input. However, there is a minor discrepancy: the recurrence rule in the tool call uses UNTIL instead of COUNT=6 as in the expected tool call, and the event_end_date is set to the last occurrence's end time rather than just the first event's end time. Despite this, the user's goal is clearly fulfilled and confirmed, with only minor technical differences., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0000000000000002, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the natural language response is compliant. The output accurately summarizes the requested recurring event, uses user-friendly date and time formats, and contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts. The language matches the input, and all information is user-facing. There are no format or content violations., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Set a recurring study block every Tue/Thu from 18:00 to 19:30 for the next 3 weeks called "Evening Study".

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: A recurring study block titled "Evening Study" has been scheduled for Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM, starting September 30 and ending October 16. The event will occur weekly as planned.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant and addressed the input directly without any irrelevant statements. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly checked for assignments due after the specified current date and accurately reported that there are no assignments due after that date, fully achieving the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.20495768743135376, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that there are no assignments due after September 29, 2025, and references the system message 'We found 0 assignments for all courses. No data available,' which is present in the context. However, it adds a specific date (September 29, 2025) that is not supported by the context, as the context only states there are zero assignments without mentioning any dates. This unsupported date is a minor fabrication, so the response is penalized but not to the lowest score, as there are no major hallucinations or financial claims., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to find out their next assignment due after the current date. The actual output clearly states that there are no assignments due after September 29, 2025, and provides the system's response for confirmation. The required tool (moodle-agent.get_assignments_for_all_courses) was called with the correct 'due_after' parameter. The response is clear, complete, and directly addresses the user's request, fulfilling all evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9939913345618183, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the response format is compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and accurately reflects the context by reporting no assignments due after the current date. The language matches the input, and the system message is paraphrased appropriately for the user., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What is my next assignment due after today?

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: There are no assignments due after September 29, 2025, in your enrolled courses. The system returned "We found 0 assignments for all courses. No data available."
  - expected output: Your next assignment is {assignment_name} due on {due_date}.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.80 because the main request to create a calendar event was addressed, but a generic offer for further assistance was included, which was not relevant to the specific task. The score is not higher due to this irrelevant statement, but it is still fairly high since the core of the input was handled., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome matches the task requirements: a 2-hour calendar event was created for the assignment, and the assignment introduction was used as the event description. The timing and content align with the instructions., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.173105856691102, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output contains unsupported and incorrect event timing: it claims the event is scheduled from October 1, 2025, at 11:00 PM CET to October 2, 2025, at 1:00 AM CET, but the context shows the event was created from 2025-10-02T01:00:00+02:00 to 2025-10-02T03:00:00+02:00 (i.e., October 2, 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM CET). The event name and description are correct and supported by context, but the fabricated start/end times are not present in the context and contradict the actual event details. No hallucinations about prizes or money are present, but the critical error in timing and unsupported claim about confirmation in the calendar (not explicitly in context) warrant a heavy penalty., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response fully aligns with the evaluation steps: the user's goal to create a 2-hour calendar event for the next due assignment with the assignment intro as description is clearly identified and fulfilled. Both required tool calls (retrieving assignments and creating the calendar event) were executed with correct parameters. The output confirms successful event creation, specifies the event details, and matches the assignment intro as the description. There are no omissions or errors, and the response is clear and complete., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8939913355716923, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses clear, natural language and contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts. It matches the input language (English) and provides user-facing details about the scheduled event, including the assignment name and timing. No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is format compliant. The only minor shortcoming is that the event title is the assignment introduction rather than the assignment name, which could cause slight confusion, but this does not violate any explicit format or content requirements., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a calendar event for my next due assignment, lasting 2 hours, with the assignment intro as description.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The 2-hour event "Analyze the provided operational scenario and submit your findings" has been scheduled for **October 1, 2025, at 11:00 PM CET** to **October 2, 2025, at 1:00 AM CET**. The description matches the assignment introduction, and the event is confirmed in your calendar. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
  - expected output: I created a calendar event "{assignment_name}" starting at {assignment_start_date} for 2 hours with the assignment intro as the description.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request directly with no irrelevant information. Great job!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The desired task was to rename an existing event titled 'Math Review' to 'Math Deep Dive'. Since the system could not find the event and therefore did not perform the rename, the task was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9777299871492542, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the event 'Math Review' could not be found and therefore could not be renamed, which is fully supported by the context ('We found 0 calendar events by the free text query: Math Review. No data available'). There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, and the output does not contradict the context. While it differs from the expected output, the expected output is factually incorrect given the context. The actual output aligns with the evaluation steps by not fabricating information and accurately reflecting the context., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.38351810255032504, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies that the event 'Math Review' could not be found and communicates this to the user, which is clear and direct. However, it falls short because it only executed the find event tool call and did not attempt the update action, as required by the expected tool calls. The user's goal to rename the event was not fulfilled, and the output does not offer any next steps or alternatives. This results in a partial but incomplete fulfillment of the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the response format is compliant. The output clearly acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request due to the absence of the 'Math Review' event, which aligns with the context indicating no such event was found. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or language mismatches present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Rename my next "Math Review" event to "Math Deep Dive".
  - actual output: The event titled "Math Review" could not be found in the calendar. As a result, the title could not be renamed to "Math Deep Dive". No new event was created.
  - expected output: I updated your upcoming event title to "Math Deep Dive".

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.00 because the output only contains an error message about a stream timeout and does not address the user's request to create a weekly 'Math Review' event., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No events were created due to a system error, so the desired task was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.0014063624835024978, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output is an error message indicating a timeout and does not provide any of the required information from the expected output. There are no claims, hallucinations, or unsupported information, but the response fails to meet the requirements of the expected output entirely., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The output is an error message indicating a timeout, with no attempt to create the requested recurring calendar event. No tool calls were made, despite the expectation to use the calendar-agent.create_calendar_event tool with the specified parameters. The user's explicit goal was not addressed or fulfilled, and there is no confirmation or result provided., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response consists solely of an internal error message ('SSE stream timeout') rather than user-facing content. No format was explicitly requested, but the output contains internal artifacts, violating the requirement for pure, natural language content. There is no acknowledgment of limitations or attempt to address the user's request., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a weekly "Math Review" every Friday 15:00–16:00 for 5 weeks.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request without any irrelevant statements. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.95, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system scheduled a 1.5-hour review session on the due date of the last past assignment, as requested. The only minor issue is that the session starts late at night (11:00 PM), which may not be ideal, but this detail was not specified in the task. Otherwise, the outcome aligns very closely with the desired task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.16791786861878394, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output contains several unsupported claims: it states the review session is scheduled for September 21, 2025, at 11:00 PM, but the context shows the event was created for September 22, 2025, at 1:00 AM (+02:00), which is 11:00 PM UTC. The output also says the event lasts until 12:30 AM the next day, which matches the 1.5-hour duration, but the time zone is not clarified. The mention of a 'provided Google Calendar link' is unsupported, as no link is given in the actual output. The event title and duration are correct, but the date and time presentation is misleading and not fully supported by the context. There are no hallucinations or fabricated financial information, but the factual mismatch and unsupported claims about the event time and link warrant a low score., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.7247493438091952, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response fulfills the user's request by scheduling a 1.5-hour review session on the due date of the last past assignment and provides clear event details. The calendar event was created as required. However, the tool calls do not exactly match the expected sequence: instead of using 'moodle-agent.get_assignments_for_all_courses' with a 'due_before' filter, the system called 'moodle-agent.get_all_courses' and then 'moodle-agent.get_assignments_for_course' for a specific course, which is less efficient and not fully aligned with the expected approach. Despite this, the end result matches the user's goal, and the output is clear and complete., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8007662199237917, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, contains no internal artifacts, and matches the input language. No specific format was requested, so the format is compliant. The event details (assignment name, date, and time) are legitimate and drawn from context. However, the output mentions a Google Calendar link ('provided Google Calendar link') but does not actually provide the link, which could be seen as a minor omission in user-facing completeness. Otherwise, the response aligns well with the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Take my last past assignment and create a 1.5 hour review session on its due date.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The 1.5-hour review session for your last past assignment has been scheduled for **September 21, 2025, at 11:00 PM**. The event is titled "Review Session for UX Research Report" and will last until 12:30 AM the next day. You can access it via the provided Google Calendar link.

  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.7351011394316685, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately states the next assignment ('Wireframe Design'), its due date (October 12), and that a 90-minute calendar event was created with the description 'Wireframe Design', all of which are supported by the context. However, the actual output specifies the event time as 21:30 to 23:00, which is not supported by the context; the context shows the event was scheduled from 23:30 to 01:00 (+02:00).

All expected tools were called with appropriate parameters. However, the event description uses only the assignment name ('Wireframe Design') instead of the assignment's intro, which was specifically requested.

  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.7077198176347107, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, contains no internal artifacts, and matches the input language. No specific format was requested, so the format is compliant. However, the event description should have used the assignment's introduction ('Create wireframes for a digital health application') as requested, but instead used only the assignment name ('Wireframe Design'). This is a minor but clear shortcoming in following the user's instructions., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request directly without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused on the task!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The desired task was to move the next 'Study Block' event 30 minutes later, but since no such event was found, the system did not perform the required action. Therefore, the actual outcome does not achieve the task at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context, which states that no calendar events named 'Study Block' were found. There are no unsupported claims or hallucinations, and the output does not contradict the context. While the expected output assumes an event was found and shifted, the actual output correctly aligns with the context data, which is the critical evaluation criterion., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.3898667196945209, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies that there are no 'Study Block' events to move, which addresses the user's request. However, only the find_calendar_events_by_free_text_query tool was called, and the update_calendar_event tool was not executed as expected. While the output is clear and not vague, it does not fully complete the task since it stops after failing to find the event, rather than attempting all expected tool calls or providing alternative solutions. This results in a partial fulfillment of the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The actual output correctly acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request due to no matching 'Study Block' events, which aligns with the context stating that no such events were found. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or language mismatches present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Move my next "Study Block" event 30 minutes later.
  - actual output: There are no calendar events named "Study Block" to move. The system could not find any events matching the query.
  - expected output: I found your upcoming "Study Block" event and shifted it 30 minutes later.

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request for details about the SAFE module without including any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system was unable to retrieve any details for the SAFE module course because it could not find the course in Moodle. As a result, the desired task was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9799059017053612, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the course 'SAFE module' could not be found, which is directly supported by the 'Course not found' entry in the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, and the output does not introduce any information not present in the context. The expected output is not possible given the context, so the actual output is appropriate and fully aligned with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.3880797082671461, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response partially aligns with the evaluation steps. The user's goal was to get details for the SAFE module. The output clearly states that the course could not be found, which is a direct answer. However, only the search_courses_by_name tool was called with 'SAFE module' as the parameter, not 'SAFE' as expected, and the get_course_details tool was not executed. This means the tool usage was incomplete and did not fully attempt to retrieve the requested details. The response is clear but does not demonstrate full action execution or exhaust all search possibilities., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and matches the input language. It appropriately acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request due to the course not being found, which is supported by the context. There are no violations of the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Get details for the SAFE module.
  - actual output: The course "SAFE module" could not be found in the Moodle system. No details are available as the course does not exist in the platform.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.40 because the answer included irrelevant details such as the event's start time, end time, and recurrence pattern, which were not requested. However, it did address the main request to add a location, so it is not lower., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome matches the desired task exactly: the location 'Library Room B' was added to the user's next 'Evening Study' calendar event.

  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9012696959460931, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately states that the location 'Library Room B' was added to the 'Evening Study' event, which is fully supported by the context. It also provides additional event details (summary, start/end times, recurrence) that are directly present in the context and do not introduce any unsupported or fabricated information. All claims are grounded in the context, and there are no hallucinations or contradictions. The only minor shortcoming is that the extra details, while accurate, go beyond the expected output, but this is acceptable per the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.8880797076413357, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response clearly confirms that the location 'Library Room B' was added to the next 'Evening Study' event and provides updated event details, directly fulfilling the user's request. The necessary tool calls to find and update the event were executed, matching the expected actions. However, the update tool call did not include the 'start' and 'end' fields as in the expected input parameters, which is a minor omission. Overall, the output is clear, complete, and demonstrates successful task completion., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the response format is compliant.

  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6149365271949223, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response directly answers the user's question by providing the name and due date of the next assignment, which fulfills the explicit goal. However, the tools called do not fully align with the expected sequence: 'get_course_details' was used instead of the required 'get_assignments_for_course'. This could impact the accuracy or completeness of the assignment information. The output is clear and complete, but the deviation in tool usage warrants a deduction., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the response format is compliant. The output is in natural, user-facing English, matches the input language, and contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts. The assignment name and due date are legitimate data from the context.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output was fully relevant and addressed the input perfectly. Great job staying on topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system scheduled four 'Safety Review' events, each on a Wednesday from 17:00 to 18:00, matching the recurrence and duration requirements. However, the events are scheduled in UTC, and it is not specified whether the original request was for UTC or local time, which could cause a minor misalignment if the intended time zone was different. Otherwise, the outcome closely matches the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9255845462463468, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists the four 'Safety Review' events on the correct dates and times, which are directly supported by the context (calendar event creation logs). The time conversion from +02:00 to UTC (17:00–18:00) is correct. The output does not introduce any unsupported claims or hallucinations. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly state the events are recurring every Wednesday, as in the expected output, but this is implied by the listed dates. All required facts are present and correct., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6953938057310889, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response confirms that four 'Safety Review' events were scheduled on the correct dates and times, directly fulfilling the user's request. However, instead of using a single recurring event as specified in the expected tool call (with recurrence rules), the system created four separate single events. This is a partial misalignment with the expected tool usage, as recurrence rules were not applied. The output is otherwise clear and complete, but the lack of proper recurrence handling prevents full credit., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8904650531887531, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses a clear, user-friendly bulleted list to present the scheduled events, which is compliant since no specific format was requested in the input. The language matches the input (English), and there are no internal artifacts or IDs present. The only minor issue is the use of 'UTC' for the time, while the context and event creation logs indicate the events are scheduled in the +02:00 timezone (likely local time). This could cause slight confusion, but otherwise, the output is natural, user-facing, and format-compliant., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Every Wednesday 17:00–18:00 for 4 weeks, create "Safety Review".

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The "Safety Review" events have been scheduled successfully for the following dates:  
- **October 1, 2025**  
- **October 8, 2025**  
- **October 15, 2025**  
- **October 22, 2025**  

Each event is set for **17:00–18:00 UTC**. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
  - expected output: I created a recurring event "Safety Review" every Wednesday 17:00–18:00 for 4 weeks.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.80 because the main request to extend the 'Evening Study' event was addressed, but the output included an offer to make further adjustments, which was not relevant to the specific task and slightly detracted from the focus., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.7, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system updated the 'Evening Study' event to end at 10:30 PM on a specific date and set a weekly recurrence, but it is unclear if the next occurrence was specifically extended to 2 hours. The update may have changed the end time for all future events rather than just the next one, and the duration of the event is not explicitly stated as 2 hours. Therefore, the outcome partially aligns with the task but lacks clarity and precision regarding the requested change., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.6484607450167601, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the 'Evening Study' event has been extended to 2 hours and that it ends at 10:30 PM on Thursday, October 16, 2025, which is supported by the context. It also accurately describes the weekly recurrence on Tuesday and Thursday, matching the recurrence rule in the context. However, the claim that 'the next occurrence after October 16 is not scheduled, as the recurrence ends on that date' is not directly supported by the context, as the recurrence rule only specifies the end date, not the absence of future scheduling. The output also adds an unnecessary conversational prompt ('Let me know if you need further adjustments!'), which is not in the expected output but is not a factual error. All claims are grounded in the context, with minor extrapolation, so the response is mostly correct but not perfect., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.7221719875162813, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies and extends the 'Evening Study' event to 2 hours, directly addressing the user's request. The necessary tool calls to find and update the event were executed. However, the output introduces additional details about recurrence rules and the end of recurrence, which were not requested by the user, and may cause confusion.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.50 because while the output included some information about assignments, much of it was irrelevant to the specific request for assignments due this week, such as assignment content, requirements, and grading details. The score is not lower because there was still some partial relevance to assignments., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly listed all assignments due this week, including their names, due dates, descriptions, and grading information, fully achieving the desired task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9777299856015768, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All claims in the actual output are directly supported by the context, including assignment names, due dates, introductions, and grades. There are no hallucinations or unsupported information. The output matches the expected output in factual content, with only minor formatting differences., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to show assignments due this week. The actual output provides a clear, complete list of assignments due within the specified week, including due dates and brief descriptions. The required tool call (moodle-agent.get_assignments_for_all_courses) was executed with the correct date parameters matching the current week. The response directly fulfills the user's goal and confirms successful task completion., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the natural language list in the output is fully compliant. All assignment data (names, due dates, introductions, grades) is present in the context and thus legitimate. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names in the output. The language matches the input (English). The response is clear, user-facing, and follows all evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show assignments due this week.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The assignments due this week are:  

1. **Operations Analysis** – Due October 1, 2025  
   *Introduction*: Analyze the provided operational scenario and submit your findings.  

2. **PPE Checklist Submission** – Due October 1, 2025

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.25, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.25 because most of the assignments listed have due dates outside the requested 10-day window, and the output incorrectly claims all due dates are within this range. However, some relevant information may still be present, which is why the score is not zero., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.3, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system listed assignments due before October 9, 2025, but included several assignments with due dates more than 10 days away (e.g., September 21, September 28, October 1), and missed the requirement to only include assignments due in the next 10 days. Therefore, the outcome only partially aligns with the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.1884472898363064, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output lists all 7 assignments from the context, but incorrectly states that all due dates fall within the 10-day window from September 29, 2025. In reality, only 'Safety Equipment Essay' (due September 28) and 'Operations Analysis' and 'PPE Checklist Submission' (due October 1) are within the next 10 days; the others are past due. This is a significant unsupported claim, as the output misrepresents assignment due dates relative to the requested window, violating evaluation steps 1, 2, and 5., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.2940457249272567, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response attempts to fulfill the user's request by providing a list of assignments, but several assignments listed have due dates outside the requested 10-day window (e.g., September 10, 14, 21, and 28), which is from September 29 to October 9, 2025. Only 'Operations Analysis' and 'PPE Checklist Submission' (due October 1) are within the correct range. The tool was called with the correct 'due_before' parameter but omitted the required 'due_after' parameter, potentially leading to inclusion of outdated assignments. The output also incorrectly claims all due dates are within the window, which is inaccurate. This demonstrates partial but flawed goal completion, with significant shortcomings in filtering and tool usage., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.31998589308543945, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language and does not include internal artifacts or IDs, which aligns with the requirements. However, it fails to filter assignments correctly: several listed assignments (e.g., 'UX Research Report', 'Hello World Program', 'Calculus Problem Set 1', 'Safety Quiz 1') have due dates before the current date (September 29, 2025) and should not be included in a digest of upcoming assignments for the next 10 days. Only 'Operations Analysis' and 'PPE Checklist Submission' (due October 1) are within the correct window, and 'Safety Equipment Essay' (due September 28) is already past due. The response also incorrectly claims all due dates fall within the 10-day window. No specific format was requested, so format compliance is not an issue, but the inclusion of outdated assignments is a significant shortcoming., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Give me a digest of upcoming assignments for the next 10 days.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: Here is the digest of upcoming assignments for the next 10 days:

1. **UX Research Report** - Due September 21  
2. **Hello World Program** - Due September 10  
3. **Calculus Problem Set 1** - Due September 14  
4. **Operations Analysis** - Due October 1  
5. **Safety Quiz 1** - Due September 14  
6. **Safety Equipment Essay** - Due September 28  
7. **PPE Checklist Submission** - Due October 1  

All due dates fall within the 10-day window from September 29, 2025.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.7142857142857143, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.71 because the answer included events outside the requested 7-day window, making some information irrelevant. However, it still listed relevant events within the correct timeframe, so it is not lower., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully listed the user's calendar events for the next 7 days, including both recurring and single events, fully meeting the task requirements., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.4496963231508233, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output lists both calendar events with correct names and approximate times, aligning with the context and expected output. However, it introduces inaccuracies: the recurrence for 'Evening Study' is described as 'weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays from September 30 at 8:00 PM until October 16 at 7:30 PM', but the context shows the event starts at 20:00 and ends at 21:30, with the recurrence rule ending at 19:30 UTC (21:30 local). The output also omits event links and slightly misstates the end time. While there are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, the factual inaccuracies and missing details warrant a significant penalty., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.3157816357347607, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to list calendar events for the next 7 days starting from the current date (2025-09-29). The actual output provides event details, but the tool was called with a start date of 2025-10-06, which is a week later than required. This means the output does not reflect the correct 7-day window and may omit relevant events. While the output format is clear and complete for the queried range, the failure to use the correct date range and tool parameters results in a significant shortcoming., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.914936528667222, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response presents the calendar events in clear, natural language, with no internal data, IDs, or artifacts present. The format is user-friendly and matches the language of the input. No specific format was requested, so the output is compliant. The only minor issue is that the 'Wireframe Design' event occurs just outside the 7-day window (October 12, while the window is September 29 to October 6), but this is a minor data accuracy issue, not a format violation., error: None)

For test case:

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output was fully relevant and addressed the request perfectly. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.95, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome closely matches the desired task: a 1-hour kickoff session for the 'Intro to Safety' course was scheduled at 09:00. The only minor ambiguity is whether October 6, 2025, is indeed 'next Monday' relative to when the task was given, and whether the time zone (UTC) matches the intended one. Otherwise, the requirements are met., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.502669578818446, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the 'Intro to Safety Kickoff' event was scheduled and provides the correct event link, which is supported by the context. However, it incorrectly specifies the event time as 'October 6, 2025, at 09:00 UTC', while the context shows the event is scheduled for 2025-10-06T11:00:00+02:00 (which is 09:00 UTC+0). The output also omits the event duration (1 hour) and the phrase 'next Monday' from the expected output, but these are minor. No hallucinations or unsupported claims are present, but the time conversion could cause confusion. Overall, the output is mostly accurate but not perfect., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly schedules the 'Intro to Safety Kickoff' event for the next Monday at 09:00, matching the user's request. Both required tool calls (searching for the course and creating the calendar event) were executed with appropriate parameters. The output provides a clear confirmation and an event link. The only minor shortcoming is a slight mismatch in the event name formatting ('Intro to Safety Kickoff' vs. 'Intro to Safety — Kickoff'), but this does not impact the fulfillment of the user's goal., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.6664900164002655, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, user-facing, and does not include internal artifacts or IDs except for the event link, which is user-appropriate. No specific format was requested, so the format is compliant. However, the event time is stated as 'October 6, 2025, at 09:00 UTC', which does not match the actual scheduled time in context ('2025-10-06T11:00:00+02:00', i.e., 09:00 UTC+0 is 11:00 local time). This could cause confusion about the event's timing. Otherwise, the output is clear and appropriate., error: None)

  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully retrieved the user's calendar events for the specified date and accurately reported that there are no events scheduled. This fully satisfies the task requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9777299861174693, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context, which states that there are 0 calendar events for September 30, 2025. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, and the factual content matches the expected output, only differing in phrasing. All evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.5423146950836932, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The output clearly answers the user's question by stating there are no events scheduled for tomorrow and provides the correct date. However, the tool used ('find_calendar_events_by_free_text_query') does not match the expected tool ('get_calendar_events' with specific start and end dates).

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output was fully relevant and addressed the input perfectly. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome fully aligns with the desired task: a 2-hour preparation session for 'Operations Level 2' was scheduled on the due date, and a calendar event was created as expected., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9679178692681616, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All claims in the actual output are directly supported by the context: the event name, date (October 1, 2025), time (12:00 PM to 2:00 PM CET), and the Google Calendar link all match the calendar event creation details in the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The output also covers the required information from the expected output, with only minor surface differences., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.8979667647807499, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response fully addresses the user's request by scheduling a 2-hour prep session for the 'Operations Level 2' assignment on its due date, specifying the correct date and time. All expected tool calls were executed: searching for the course, retrieving assignments, and creating the calendar event. The output provides clear confirmation and a calendar link. The only minor shortcoming is a slight mismatch in the event start time formatting (12:00 PM to 2:00 PM CET in the output vs. 10:00 to 12:00 UTC in the tool call), but this does not impact the overall fulfillment of the user's goal., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9164980643070008, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses clear, user-friendly language and presents the event details in a natural format, with no internal data, IDs, or artifacts present. The date and time are formatted for user readability, and the event link is provided as expected. No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is compliant. The only minor shortcoming is that the session is scheduled for 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, while the assignment is due at 11:00 PM, so the session is not precisely on the due date's deadline, but this does not affect format compliance., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a 2-hour prep session for the next "Operations Level 2" assignment on its due date.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The 2-hour "Operations Level 2 Prep Session" has been scheduled for **October 1, 2025** from **12:00 PM to 2:00 PM CET**. You can access the event via the provided link: [Google Calendar Event](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=N3MxajZiNnQ1OWsycW1wNTZqajlmcGdrYmsgY3JpbXBhbHRAbQ).

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.25, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.25 because most of the output included irrelevant details, such as events not occurring on the requested weekend and unnecessary end times, which did not address the user's specific request for this weekend's events., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully listed scheduled events for the upcoming weekend, including event names, dates, and times. However, the end time for 'Evening Study' appears to extend well beyond the weekend, which could cause confusion. Otherwise, the core task of showing weekend events was achieved., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.4490008115620676, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The Actual Output lists 'Evening Study' and 'Safety Review' events, which are supported by the context. However, it incorrectly states that these are the only events for the weekend of September 30, 2025 - October 1, 2025, omitting the 'Analyze the provided operational scenario and submit your findings.' event, which occurs on October 2, 2025 and may be relevant depending on the user's weekend definition. The output also formats the date range as a weekend, but does not clarify the inclusion/exclusion of events spanning those dates. No hallucinated or fabricated information is present, but a required event from the expected output is missing, resulting in a low score., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.5300815421368175, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response provides a clear list of events for the specified weekend, directly addressing the user's request. However, there is a significant issue with the tool call: the dates used (September 30 and October 1, 2025) correspond to Tuesday and Wednesday, not the weekend (which would be Saturday, September 30 and Sunday, October 1, 2025, if those were the correct days, but in 2025, September 30 is a Tuesday). This indicates a misunderstanding of the weekend dates based on the current date (Monday, September 29, 2025). The output is otherwise clear and complete, but the misalignment with the actual weekend dates and the tool call parameters reduces the score., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9320821313812159, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and matches the language of the input. No specific format was requested, so the bulleted list is acceptable. The events listed ('Evening Study' and 'Safety Review') are legitimate user-facing data from the context. The only minor issue is the weekend dates: September 30, 2025 is a Tuesday and October 1, 2025 is a Wednesday, so the response misidentifies the weekend, but this is a data accuracy issue, not a format violation., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show me my events for this weekend.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: Your events for this weekend (September 30, 2025 - October 1, 2025) are:

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the input perfectly. Great job staying focused and on-topic!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully identified the user's next 'Evening Study' calendar event and updated its description to include 'Bring OSHA Quick Card', fully achieving the desired task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9088750040175567, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context: it confirms that the 'Evening Study' event was updated to include 'Bring OSHA Quick Card' in its description, matches the recurrence rule (weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays until October 16, 2025), start date (September 30, 2025), time (8:00 PM), and location (Library Room B). All these details are present in the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor issue is that the expected output is more concise, but the actual output provides additional factual details from the context, which is acceptable per the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response confirms that the next 'Evening Study' event was updated with 'Bring OSHA Quick Card' in its description and provides relevant event details, directly addressing the user's request. However, the tool calls show that the update replaced the entire description with 'Bring OSHA Quick Card' instead of appending it to the original description as specified in the expected tool call. Additionally, the find event tool was called twice unnecessarily. While the user's goal is mostly fulfilled, the improper handling of the event description and redundant tool usage reduce the alignment with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the natural language response is compliant. The output contains only user-facing information, accurately summarizes the event details from context, and does not include any internal data, IDs, or artifacts. The language matches the input, and all information provided is legitimate and relevant., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find my next "Evening Study" and add "Bring OSHA Quick Card" to its description.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.3333333333333333, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.33 because the output included irrelevant details such as assignment due dates and requirements, instead of just listing the assignments as requested. The score is not lower because the actual assignments were still listed, but the extra information reduced the relevancy., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided all assignments for both specified courses in a single, combined list, including additional helpful details such as due dates and descriptions. This fully meets the requirements of the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8493267781615195, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists all assignments for both 'Intro to Safety' and 'Digital Health UX' with correct names, due dates, and brief descriptions, all of which are directly supported by the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor deviation is the formatting and the use of paraphrased assignment descriptions, but these do not alter the factual content. The output is more detailed than the expected output but does not introduce any incorrect or fabricated information., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to show assignments for both 'Intro to Safety' and 'Digital Health UX' in one list. The actual output provides a clear, complete list of assignments for both courses, including assignment names, due dates, and brief descriptions. All expected tool calls were executed as required to retrieve the necessary information. The response is direct, complete, and confirms successful task completion, fully aligning with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9985936372737223, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input did not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output presents all assignments for both 'Intro to Safety' and 'Digital Health UX' in a clear, user-friendly list, accurately reflecting the assignment names, due dates (in user-friendly format), and brief descriptions as found in the context. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or non-user-facing data, and the language matches the input. The response fully aligns with the evaluation steps., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.60 because while the answer provided some information related to the course, it included irrelevant details about course structure and assignment due dates, which did not address the user's request to find the next session and add a location. The score is not lower because there was still some partial relevance to the course context., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.2, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system did not achieve the main task of finding the next 'Digital Health UX' session and adding the location 'Design Lab 2'. Instead, it searched for existing events with that location (finding none) and retrieved course details, but did not update or add any calendar event as requested., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.3394083479652202, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that no calendar events were found for 'Digital Health UX', which is supported by the context. It also accurately references retrieving course structure and assignments from Moodle, and mentions assignments due on 2025-09-29, which aligns with the context. However, it fails to mention adding the location 'Design Lab 2' to the session, which is a required fact in the expected output and not supported by the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, but the omission of the required action results in a significant penalty., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.25, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to find the next 'Digital Health UX' session and add the location 'Design Lab 2'. The actual output failed to update the calendar event with the new location, as required. The expected tool calls included both finding the event and updating it, but only the search was attempted, and the update was not executed. The output is incomplete, does not confirm task completion, and requests more information instead of fulfilling the request. Additionally, unnecessary Moodle tools were called, which do not contribute to the user's explicit goal., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8679178699175394, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names, and matches the input language (English). It appropriately acknowledges the inability to find or add a calendar event due to missing date/time information, which aligns with the evaluation steps. The only minor shortcoming is a slightly technical phrasing ('retrieved from Moodle'), but this does not constitute an internal artifact or format violation., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find my next "Digital Health UX" session and add the location "Design Lab 2".

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The next "Digital Health UX" session details have been retrieved from Moodle, confirming the course structure and assignments. However, no calendar events were found matching the criteria for "Digital Health UX" in "Design Lab 2". The course includes weeks with assignments due on 2025-09-29. If you need to create a calendar event for the next session, please provide specific dates or times for the session.
  - expected output: I found your upcoming "Digital Health UX" session and added the location "Design Lab 2".

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused on the input!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome did not provide any external links for 'Computer Science Fundamentals', which was the core requirement of the task. The absence of external links means the task was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9679178705669171, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that neither the Moodle Agent nor the Calendar Agent can retrieve external links, which is fully supported by the context describing their capabilities. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, and the output accurately reflects the limitations described in the context. While the expected output assumes the ability to retrieve external links, the actual output correctly explains why this is not possible, aligning with the context and evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.17772998663336156, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly identifies that the available tools may not directly provide external links, but it fails to attempt the expected tool calls (searching for the course and retrieving its details), which could potentially contain relevant links. The output is clear about the limitation, but it does not execute the required actions, resulting in an incomplete fulfillment of the user's request., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9222700143984233, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output clearly acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request due to tool limitations, referencing the Moodle and Calendar Agents as described in the context. The language matches the input, and there are no internal artifacts or IDs present. The only minor issue is the mention of agent names, but since these are explained in the context and relevant to the user's request, this is acceptable., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show external links for "Computer Science Fundamentals".
  - actual output: I cannot retrieve external links for "Computer Science Fundamentals" using the available tools. Neither the Moodle Agent (for academic content) nor the Calendar Agent (for scheduling) are capable of fetching external resources. All information must come from tool/agent call results, and neither domain supports this task.
  - expected output: External links in "Computer Science Fundamentals": {urls}.

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.1875, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.19 because most of the output discusses unrelated course sections, assignments, and resources instead of directly addressing the location or identification of the 'SAFE' module. The answer only minimally relates to the input, which is why the score is not higher., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system successfully found the module named 'SAFE' and provided detailed information about it, fully achieving the desired task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.4606977360986099, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately identifies the course and its sections, and most details about forums, assignments, and pages are supported by the context. However, it introduces some minor unsupported details, such as the explicit mention of 'links to OSHA standards and safety training videos' in the syllabus (the syllabus does not list these links, though they are present as separate modules), and the 'implied' final exam (the context only references a study guide and grading breakdown, not an explicit exam module). These are minor extrapolations, not major hallucinations, but they are not strictly supported by the context. All major facts from the expected output are present, but the output is not fully precise with context details., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9182425523806357, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to find the module 'SAFE'. The output provides a detailed description of the 'SAFE' module, including its course name, sections, and content, directly fulfilling the request. The expected tool call to search for the course by name was executed, and an additional relevant tool call to get course details was also made, which supports a thorough response. The output is clear, complete, and confirms successful task completion. A minor deduction is made because the output could have explicitly stated the course ID or direct search result, but overall, it strongly aligns with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9851952798209368, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and accurately summarizes the course and its sections using only information present in the context. The language matches the input, and no internal IDs or agent/tool names are present. All evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find the module "SAFE".
  - actual output: The module "SAFE" corresponds to the course **"Intro to Safety"**, which includes the following sections:

1. **General**  
   - Forums: Announcements, Course Announcements, General Discussion

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output was fully relevant and directly addressed the request for external links related to 'Advanced Mathematics'. Great job staying focused!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system did not provide any external links for 'Advanced Mathematics', which was the core requirement of the task. The lack of available tools was cited, but the desired outcome was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.8984156253136666, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately states that the Moodle and Calendar agents do not support retrieving external links, which is consistent with the context describing their capabilities. It does not hallucinate or introduce unsupported claims. However, it does not directly provide the expected output format listing external links, but this is justified by the context limitations. The response is factually correct and well-aligned with the evaluation steps, with only a minor deviation from the expected output format., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.15621765008857982, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly states the limitation of the available tools regarding external links, which shows some understanding of the system's capabilities. However, it does not attempt to use the expected Moodle tools to search for the course or retrieve its details, as indicated in the Expected Tools. No tool calls were made, and the output does not attempt to fulfill the user's request or provide any partial information from the available data. This results in a low score due to lack of action and incomplete fulfillment of the user's goal., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output clearly acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request due to tool limitations, which is appropriate. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or non-user-facing data present, and the language matches the input. The response aligns fully with the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show external links for "Advanced Mathematics".
  - actual output: I cannot retrieve external links for "Advanced Mathematics" using the available tools. The Moodle and Calendar agents only support internal course/assignment data and calendar events, not external web resources.
  - expected output: External links in "Advanced Mathematics": {urls}.
  - context: ['The Moodle Agent is a specialized AI assistant for Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) operations.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.2, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.20 because most of the output focused on the AI's limitations and information sourcing rather than actually summarizing the Python Style Guide as requested. Only a small portion, if any, addressed the input directly, which is why the score is not higher., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system did not provide any summary of the 'Python Style Guide' as requested. No attempt was made to fulfill the task, and no relevant information was given., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.9679178699175394, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the requested task (summarizing a 'Python Style Guide' document) is not possible given the available agents and their described capabilities in the context. It does not introduce any unsupported claims or hallucinations, and accurately reflects the limitations described in the context. No required facts from the expected output are present in the context, so the refusal is appropriate., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.10373268888166232, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response fails to attempt the expected tool calls (searching for the course and retrieving its details) and does not try to fulfill the user's request to summarize the 'Python Style Guide' in 'Computer Science Fundamentals.' Instead, it prematurely claims inability without leveraging the available tools, resulting in a lack of direct action or partial fulfillment., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format or structure, so the response is format compliant. The output appropriately acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request due to agent limitations, as supported by the context, and contains no internal data, artifacts, or language mismatches. All evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Summarize "Python Style Guide" in "Computer Science Fundamentals".
  - actual output: I cannot answer this question as it is outside the available domains (Moodle and Calendar agents). All information must come from tool/agent call results. The requested task involves summarizing a "Python Style Guide" document, which is not within the scope of the available agents' capabilities (retrieving course content, assignments, or calendar events).
  - expected output: Here is the summary of "Python Style Guide" from Computer Science Fundamentals: {summary}.
  - context: ['The Moodle Agent is a specialized AI assistant for Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) operations. It provides comprehensive access to course management, assignment tracking, and user information through a set of powerful MCP tools.

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.00 because all the statements in the output list assignments due in October 2025, while the input specifically asks for assignments due in September 2025. None of the output addresses the actual request, resulting in a completely irrelevant response., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly listed all assignments due in the specified month (October 2025), including their names and due dates, which fully aligns with the task requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.998201378635318, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All assignments listed in the actual output are directly supported by the context, including their names and due dates. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The output matches the expected factual content, with only minor formatting differences. No required facts are missing or incorrect., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.9482566683642437, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response correctly interprets the user's request to show assignments due this month and provides a clear, itemized list of assignments with due dates in October 2025. The required tool call was executed with the correct parameters for the date range. The only minor shortcoming is that the current date is September 29, 2025, so 'this month' could be interpreted as September, but the output assumes October, which may cause slight ambiguity. Otherwise, the response is complete and fulfills the user's goal., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8951858707503801, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses a clear, user-friendly bulleted list to present the assignments due in October 2025, matching the data in CONTEXT. No specific format was requested in the input, so the format is compliant. The output contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and the language matches the input. The only minor issue is that the input asks for assignments due 'this month' (September), but the output lists assignments for October; however, based on the current date (September 29), it is reasonable to interpret 'this month' as the upcoming month for due dates, so this is a minor ambiguity., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Show assignments due this month.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The assignments due this month (October 2025) are:  
- **Wireframe Design** (October 12, 2025)  
- **Data Structures Project** (October 27, 2025)  
- **Linear Algebra Assignment** (October 12, 2025)  
- **Operations Analysis** (October 1, 2025)  
- **PPE Checklist Submission** (October 1, 2025)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant and addressed the question directly without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome directly confirms that the 'Intro to Safety' course has a forum specifically named 'Announcements' for course-related updates, which fully satisfies the task requirement., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.6152716755810397, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states that the 'Intro to Safety' course includes a forum named 'Announcements' in its 'General' section, which is supported by the context. However, it adds that this forum is for 'course-related updates,' which is not explicitly stated in the context. The context only provides the forum name and location, not its purpose. This is a minor unsupported claim, so a moderate penalty is applied, but the main factual content matches the expected output., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to determine if the 'Intro to Safety' course has a forum for announcements. The actual output directly answers this by confirming the existence of an 'Announcements' forum in the course's 'General' section. Both expected tool calls (searching for the course and retrieving its details) were executed as required. The response is clear, complete, and confirms successful task completion., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The answer is accurate, directly addressing the question by confirming the existence of an 'Announcements' forum in the 'Intro to Safety' course, which is supported by the context. The output contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and is in natural, user-facing English matching the input language., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Does "Intro to Safety" have a forum for announcements?
  - actual output: Yes, the "Intro to Safety" course includes a forum named "Announcements" in its "General" section for course-related updates.
  - expected output: "Intro to Safety" contains an announcements forum: {forum_name}.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.00 because the output only provided an error message about a stream timeout and did not address the request for section names related to 'Computer Science Fundamentals' at all., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome did not provide any section names as requested due to a system timeout error, so the task was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.009720501150871743, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output contains an error message about an SSE stream timeout, which is not present in the context. The context is empty, so any information in the actual output is unsupported and constitutes a hallucination. This aligns with the critical evaluation steps requiring a score of zero for unsupported or fabricated content., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to list section names for the course 'Computer Science Fundamentals.' The actual output was an error message indicating a timeout, with no tool calls executed, despite two expected tool calls being specified. The response did not address the user's request or provide any relevant information, resulting in complete failure to fulfill the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.18986671994133764, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response does not follow a user-facing format and instead returns an internal error message, which is a clear violation of the evaluation steps. No specific format was requested in the input, so the main issue is the presence of internal error artifacts in the output, which are not legitimate user-facing data. There is no evidence of internal data from context, but the output is not compliant with the requirement for pure, natural language content., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List section names for "Computer Science Fundamentals".
  - actual output: ERROR: Error: SSE stream timeout after 360000ms - no final response received
  - expected output: Section names for "Computer Science Fundamentals": {section_titles}.
  - context: []

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.8, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.80 because while the main request to create 1-hour study slots was addressed, the output included information about accessing the event via a Google Calendar link, which was not relevant to the task. However, the core scheduling requirement was still met, keeping the score relatively high., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system scheduled a 1-hour study slot on one day when assignments are due, but the task required creating a 1-hour study slot on each day an assignment is due this week. There may be more than one due date this week, but only one slot was scheduled, so the outcome is only partially aligned with the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.44326031560223295, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly identifies the assignments and their due date, and references the creation of a 1-hour study session event. However, it incorrectly claims that the event is scheduled from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM (UTC+2), while the context shows the event is from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM (UTC+2). It also states that the event aligns with both assignments' due dates, which is accurate. The mention of a Google Calendar link is supported by context. The main shortcoming is the fabricated event time, which is not supported by the context and contradicts the actual event time. This is a significant factual error, so a substantial penalty is applied., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.5519643032405488, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response partially fulfills the user's request by scheduling a 1-hour study session on the assignment due date (October 1, 2025) and confirms the event creation. However, it only creates a single generic 'Study Session' event rather than individual events for each assignment as implied by the expected tool calls and event naming. The tool calls show the correct retrieval of assignments and event creation, but the event details (name and description) do not match the expected format, and only one event is created despite two assignments being due. This results in incomplete alignment with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8970687766757741, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format, so the response is format compliant. The output is in clear, natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and matches the input language. It references assignment names and dates that are present in the context, and provides a user-friendly summary. The only minor issue is a slight mismatch between the scheduled time (10:00 AM to 11:00 AM) and the actual event time in the context (12:00 to 13:00), but this does not affect format compliance., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Create a 1-hour study slot on each day an assignment is due this week.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: A 1-hour study session has been scheduled for **October 1, 2025**, from **10:00 AM to 11:00 AM** (UTC+2). This aligns with the due dates of the assignments **"Operations Analysis"** and **"PPE Checklist Submission"**, both due on October 1, 2025. The event is accessible via the provided Google Calendar link.
  - expected output: I created 1-hour study events for each assignment due day this week.

  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.09241418241572634, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output claims that the user is free next Thursday (October 3, 2025) between 14:00 and 16:00 and that the time slot is confirmed available. However, the context only provides a recurring event ('Safety Study') that occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays, with no explicit listing of events for the specific date and time in question. The output asserts availability without confirming whether the time slot is free or occupied, which is unsupported by the context. This is a critical unsupported claim, resulting in a heavily penalized score., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to check availability for next Thursday between 14:00 and 16:00. The output directly answers the question, confirming the user is free at the specified time. The required tool call to check calendar events for the correct time range was executed. The response is clear, complete, and confirms task completion, fully aligning with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: No specific format or structure was requested in the input, so the natural language response is compliant. The output contains no internal data, IDs, or artifacts, and presents the date in a user-friendly format. The language matches the input (English), and all information is user-facing. There are no format violations or internal artifacts present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Am I free next Thursday between 14:00 and 16:00?

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: Yes, you are free next Thursday (October 3, 2025) between 14:00 and 16:00. The time slot is confirmed to be available.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5714285714285714, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.57 because the answer included several irrelevant statements about information sourcing and process, rather than focusing on what can be done in Moodle. However, it was not lower because there was at least some attempt to address the question., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system did not perform any actions or provide any information regarding Moodle, which was the core requirement of the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.24463226091865783, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output does not contain any hallucinated or fabricated information and does not contradict the context, but it fails to provide the required factual details present in the expected output. It is overly cautious and omits key capabilities of the Moodle agent, such as searching courses, listing assignments, and managing calendar events, all of which are supported by the context. The response is incomplete and does not fulfill the requirements of the expected output., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.27072710513706905, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's input is a general inquiry about the assistant's capabilities in Moodle. The response partially addresses this by listing possible actions (retrieving course content, assignments, grades, and user information), but it is hedged with disclaimers about needing tool calls and does not confidently or clearly answer the question. There were no expected tool calls, so none were missed, but the output is unnecessarily vague and does not fully fulfill the user's request for information., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.6738114013410703, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input did not specify any required format or language, so the response is format compliant. The output does not contain internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names beyond what is present in the context. The response appropriately acknowledges its limitations. However, the statement 'All information must come from tool/agent call results' is somewhat meta and not fully user-facing natural language, which slightly detracts from the user experience. Otherwise, the output aligns well with the evaluation steps., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: What can you do for me in Moodle?
  - actual output: I cannot answer that. All information must come from tool/agent call results. The Moodle agent can retrieve course content, assignments, grades, and user information, but this must be confirmed through specific tool calls.
  - expected output: I can search courses, list enrolled courses, fetch course details, list assignments (by course or across all courses with time filters), and create or update calendar events.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the response was fully relevant and addressed the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and helpful!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system fully achieved the task by listing the assignments due this week and providing a detailed calendar schedule for the current week, including relevant events and deadlines., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.932482267096779, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: All assignments and events listed in the actual output are directly supported by the context, including assignment names, due dates, and event details. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor issue is that the actual output adds formatting and a note to 'bring OSHA Quick Card' for the 'Evening Study' event, which is present in the context as the event description. The structure differs from the expected output, but all required facts are present and accurate. No critical errors or fabricated information are present., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to retrieve this week's assignments and calendar schedule. The actual output provides a clear, complete list of assignments with due dates and a detailed calendar schedule for the week, directly fulfilling the user's goal. Both expected tool calls (for assignments and calendar events within the correct date range) were executed as required. The response is specific, complete, and confirms successful task completion with no missing or vague information., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response uses clear, user-friendly natural language and presents the assignments and calendar events in a readable bulleted and numbered list format. No specific format was requested in the input, so the output is compliant. All data shown (assignment names, due dates, event titles, times, and descriptions) are present in the context and are legitimate user-facing data.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.75, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.75 because while the main request to schedule the session was addressed, the offer to make further adjustments was unnecessary and did not directly relate to the specific scheduling task, slightly reducing the overall relevancy., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual outcome matches the desired task exactly: a 45-minute reading session for 'Hazard Types Overview' was scheduled for tomorrow at 18:00., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.2836366422642228, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output correctly states the session title, duration, and that it is scheduled for tomorrow, aligning with the expected output. However, it specifies the time as 6:00 PM UTC, which is not directly supported by the context. The context provides the event time as 2025-09-30T20:00:00+02:00, which is 18:00 UTC, so the time is correct but the explicit mention of UTC is not in the context. The claim that the event is 'confirmed and ready for your calendar' is not directly supported by the context, which only states the event was created. There are no hallucinations or fabricated financial information, but the output includes minor unsupported claims, warranting a significant penalty., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.7731058572770513, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response confirms that a 45-minute session titled 'Hazard Types Overview' was scheduled for tomorrow at 18:00, directly addressing the user's request. The necessary calendar event tool was called with the correct date and time. However, the event name in the tool call ('Hazard Types Overview') does not exactly match the expected ('Read: Hazard Types Overview'), and the event description is missing. Additionally, the output mentions '6:00 PM UTC' instead of the user's local time, which could cause confusion. Despite these minor discrepancies, the main goal is fulfilled and the task is completed., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.7471472409781861, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, contains no internal artifacts, and matches the input language. No specific format was requested, so the format is compliant. However, the output states the session is scheduled for 'tomorrow at 6:00 PM UTC', which is a time zone conversion error: the user requested 18:00 local time (CEST, UTC+2), but the output gives 18:00 UTC (which is 20:00 local time). This could cause user confusion. Otherwise, the response is clear and user-facing., error: None)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.53125, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.53 because much of the output included information about course content, objectives, materials, hazards, procedures, and exam tips, which are not directly related to listing the side blocks as requested. However, some relevant information was present, which is why the score is not lower., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided a detailed and accurate list of the side blocks in the 'Intro to Safety' course, fully meeting the requirements of the task., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.894043387639426, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists all side blocks and their contents for 'Intro to Safety', matching the context's course structure and module details. All non-trivial claims, such as module names, types, and detailed syllabus, are directly supported by the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. Minor paraphrasing (e.g., 'assemble at meeting point' vs. 'designated meeting point') is present but does not affect factual accuracy. The only minor shortcoming is the inclusion of some inline details (like 'do not attempt cleanup' without 'unless trained'), but these are not fabrications and are contextually supported. All required facts from the expected output are present., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to list the side blocks in 'Intro to Safety'. The actual output provides a detailed, organized list of all side blocks and their contents, directly fulfilling the request. Both expected tool calls (searching for the course and retrieving its details) were executed as required. The response is clear, complete, and confirms successful task completion with no missing or vague information., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.8956259737536166, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in natural language, matches the input language (English), and presents the requested information in a clear, user-facing bulleted/numbered list. No specific format was requested in the input, so the structure is compliant. All data provided (block names, module names, and summaries) are present in the context and are legitimate user-facing data. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or agent/tool names. The only minor issue is that the response includes some synthesized sub-bullets (e.g., detailed breakdowns under 'Course Syllabus' and 'Emergency Procedures') that, while accurate and based on context, slightly expand on the original context structure. However, this does not violate any evaluation step, so only a minor deduction is warranted., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: List the side blocks in "Intro to Safety".
  - actual output: The side blocks in "Intro to Safety" are:  

1. **General**  
   - Announcements (Forum)  
   - Course Announcements (Forum)  
   - General Discussion (Forum)  
   - Course Syllabus (Page)

======================================================================

======================================================================

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.4, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.40 because the answer included several irrelevant details, such as the event's recurrence pattern, location, and unchanged description, which do not address the core request to find and rename the event. However, it is not lower because the answer did attempt to address the main task., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system found the next 'Evening Study' event and changed its title to 'Safety Study' as requested. All other event details remained unchanged, which aligns with the task requirements., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.7950076143116056, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context: the event was renamed from 'Evening Study' to 'Safety Study', the timing (weekly on Tuesday and Thursday from September 30, 2025 to October 16, 2025), location (Library Room B), and description ('Bring OSHA Quick Card') all match the context. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor issue is that the actual output is more verbose than the expected output, but all facts are supported and required information is present., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.8377540668798146, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response directly fulfills the user's request by confirming the next 'Evening Study' event was found and its title changed to 'Safety Study', including clear event details. Both required tool calls were executed: finding the event and updating it. However, the update tool call only included the new summary and omitted explicit start and end times as in the expected parameters, which is a minor shortcoming. The output is otherwise clear, complete, and confirms successful completion., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any required format or structure, so the response is format compliant. The output is in clear, natural language, contains no internal data or artifacts, and accurately summarizes the event update using only user-facing details from the context. The language matches the input, and no internal IDs or agent/tool names are present. All evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Find my next "Evening Study" and change the title to "Safety Study".

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: The next "Evening Study" event has been updated to "Safety Study". The event now occurs weekly on Tuesday and Thursday from September 30, 2025 at 8:00 PM to October 16, 2025 at 11:30 PM in Library Room B. The description "Bring OSHA Quick Card" remains unchanged.
  - expected output: I found your upcoming event and renamed it to "Safety Study".

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.7777777777777778, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.78 because while the output included some relevant information about assignments and calendar events, it also contained details about assignment content and requirements, which were not requested and thus reduced the overall relevancy., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided both assignments due and calendar events for the specified 7-day period, fully meeting the requirements of the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.47282624564768644, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists all assignments and events found in the context, with correct names, dates, and instructions. However, it introduces section headers ('Assignments Due', 'Calendar Events') and paraphrases some instructions, which is acceptable. The main shortcoming is that the output does not follow the required format from the expected output, which asks for a specific phrasing ('Assignments due in the next 7 days: ... Events in the next 7 days: ...'). No hallucinated or unsupported information is present, but the format mismatch is significant., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0000000000000002, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to provide a week-ahead brief including assignments due and calendar events for the next 7 days. The actual output clearly lists both assignments due within the specified timeframe and relevant calendar events, directly fulfilling the user's goal. Both expected tool calls (for assignments and calendar events) were executed with correct parameters matching the date range. The response is complete, specific, and confirms successful task completion with no vagueness or omissions., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9500000000000002, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response provides a clear, user-friendly week-ahead brief with assignments and calendar events, using natural language and no internal artifacts. The format is appropriate, with bolded section headers and bulleted/numbered lists, even though no specific format was requested. All data (assignment names, event titles, dates) are present in the context and are legitimate. The only minor issue is the use of 'UTC' and 'UTC+2' in the time listings, which could be slightly more user-friendly, but this does not constitute a significant format violation. No internal IDs, agent/tool names, or raw JSON are present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Give me a week-ahead brief: assignments due and my calendar for the next 7 days.

The current date is 2025-09-29T10:11:19.193+02:00.
  - actual output: Here is your week-ahead brief:

**Assignments Due:**  
- **Operations Analysis** – Due October 1, 2025 at 11:00 PM UTC. Instructions: Analyze the provided operational scenario and submit your findings.  
- **PPE Checklist Submission** – Due October 1, 2025 at 11:00 PM UTC. Instructions: Upload your completed PPE inspection checklist.  

**Calendar Events:**  
1. **Analyze the provided operational scenario...** – October 2, 2025, 1:00 AM to 3:00 AM UTC+2.  
2. **Safety Review** – October 1, 2025, 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM UTC+2.  
3. **Operations Level 2 Prep Session** – October 1, 2025, 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM UTC+2.
