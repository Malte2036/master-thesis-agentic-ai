Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the answer was fully relevant and addressed the question directly without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system did not provide the next due date for 'Verteilte Systeme' as requested, and explicitly stated it could not find any information. Therefore, the task was not achieved at all., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.21726166052230997, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output states that no information could be found, which is not supported by the context. The context clearly provides the assignment name and due date, and the expected output references this information. The response omits required facts and fails to provide information present in the context, but does not hallucinate or introduce unsupported claims., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.1, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to find the next assignment deadline for 'Verteilte Systeme'. The response failed to provide this information and did not execute the expected tool call (moodle.get_upcoming_assignments). Instead, unrelated tools (calendar.list_events and weather.get_forecast) were called, which do not address the user's request. The output is vague and does not confirm any attempt to fulfill the goal., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.2853000963118345, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in the correct language (German) and contains no internal artifacts or IDs. However, it fails to provide the requested information about the next due date for 'Verteilte Systeme', which is present in the context ('Übungsblatt 1' due on 14. Dezember 2025). The response incorrectly claims no information is available, missing key user-facing data from context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Wann ist die nächste Abgabe für Verteilte Systeme?
  - actual output: Ich konnte keine Information finden.
  - expected output: Die nächste Abgabe ist 'Übungsblatt 1' am 14. Dezember 2025.
  - context: ['Current date for evaluation: 2025-12-10', 'Course: Verteilte Systeme', 'Assignment: Übungsblatt 1', 'Due date: 2025-12-14T23:59:00Z']

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.00 because the response only mentioned the date of the next lecture, which is irrelevant to the question about the assignment deadline for Verteilte Systeme., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.95, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided the date and time of the next lecture, which is likely the next due date for the course. However, if 'due date' refers specifically to an assignment or exam deadline rather than the next lecture, there could be a slight mismatch. Overall, the outcome closely aligns with the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output claims that the next lecture is on December 15, 2025 at 10:00, but there is no mention of any lecture or this date/time in the context. The context only provides information about an assignment ('Übungsblatt 1') due on December 14, 2025. This is a clear hallucination and not supported by the context, and the required fact from the expected output is missing., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.2, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's explicit goal was to find out the next assignment due date for 'Verteilte Systeme'. The actual output instead provides the date and time of the next lecture, which does not address the user's request. Additionally, the expected tool call was to retrieve upcoming assignments, but the tool used fetched the course schedule instead. The response is off-topic and does not confirm task completion, resulting in a low score., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.24564097699554646, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input asks for the next assignment due date for 'Verteilte Systeme', but the response gives the date and time of the next lecture instead, which is not requested or supported by the context. The response is in the correct language (German) and contains no internal artifacts or IDs, but it fails to provide the requested information or follow the implicit structure of the question., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Wann ist die nächste Abgabe für Verteilte Systeme?
  - actual output: Die nächste Vorlesung findet am Montag, den 15. Dezember 2025 um 10:00 Uhr statt.

  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.926894143308898, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately reflects the context and expected output, stating that a calendar entry for 'Verteilte Systeme - Übungsblatt 1' was created for December 14, 2025, at 23:59. All claims are supported by the context, and there are no hallucinations or unsupported information. The only minor difference is the phrasing, which is acceptable per the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to create a calendar entry for the submission of 'Übungsblatt 1' in 'Verteilte Systeme' on December 14, 2025, at 23:59. The actual output confirms that this calendar entry was created with the correct title, date, and time. Both expected tool calls (retrieving assignment details and creating the calendar event) were executed as required. The response is clear, complete, and directly confirms successful task completion, fully aligning with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in German, matching the input language.

  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system correctly identified the next assignment ('Übungsblatt 2') and its deadline (December 21, 2025) for the course 'Verteilte Systeme', fully achieving the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output claims that the next assignment is 'Übungsblatt 2' due on 21. Dezember 2025, but the context only mentions 'Übungsblatt 1' with a due date of 14. Dezember 2025. There is no support in the context for 'Übungsblatt 2' or the date 21.

  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.30229773678610766, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to find the next assignment deadline for 'Verteilte Systeme'. The actual output provides a specific answer, but the tool was called with the course name 'Datenbanken' instead of 'Verteilte Systeme'. This means the necessary action was not executed as required, and the result may be incorrect or unrelated. While the output is clear and complete in form, it is not grounded in the correct tool execution, which is a significant shortcoming., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.2559136637105047, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in the correct language and uses natural, user-facing language, but it introduces an assignment ('Übungsblatt 2' due on 21. Dezember 2025) that does not appear in the provided context. The only assignment in context is 'Übungsblatt 1' due on 14. Dezember 2025. This violates the requirement to avoid introducing data not present in context, resulting in a significant penalty., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Wann ist die nächste Abgabe für Verteilte Systeme?

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 1.00 because the output was fully relevant and addressed the request without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and concise!, error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: Alle kommenden Abgaben für den Kurs wurden korrekt angezeigt und für die nächsten drei wurden Kalendereinträge erstellt, wie in der Aufgabe gefordert., error: None)
  - ✅ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.906008665185713, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output accurately lists all three assignments and their due dates, which are fully supported by the context. It also states that calendar entries were created for all three, which aligns with the context mentioning calendar events created. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims. The only minor difference is the phrasing, which is acceptable. All required facts from the expected output are present., error: None)
  - ✅ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's request was to display all upcoming assignments and create calendar entries for the next three. The actual output lists the three upcoming assignments with their due dates and confirms that calendar entries were created for all three. All expected tool calls were executed as required, and the output provides clear confirmation of task completion. There are no omissions or vagueness, and the response fully aligns with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in German, matching the input language. No specific format (such as Markdown, lists, or JSON) was requested, so the natural language output is compliant. The response lists all upcoming assignments with correct names and user-friendly dates, and confirms calendar entries for the next three, aligning with the context. There are no internal artifacts, IDs, or non-user-facing data present., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Zeige mir alle kommenden Abgaben und erstelle Kalendereinträge für die nächsten drei.
  - actual output: Ich habe die folgenden Abgaben gefunden: Übungsblatt 1 (14.12.2025), Übungsblatt 2 (21.12.2025), Übungsblatt 3 (28.12.2025). Kalendereinträge wurden für alle drei erstellt.
  - expected output: Abgaben gefunden: Übungsblatt 1 (14.12.2025), Übungsblatt 2 (21.12.2025), Übungsblatt 3 (28.12.2025). Kalendereinträge erstellt.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.00 because all statements in the output are irrelevant to the question about the next submission date for 'Verteilte Systeme', discussing unrelated topics like exams, lottery winnings, and fees instead., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.6, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: Die Antwort enthält die relevante Information zum nächsten Abgabetermin (die Klausur findet morgen statt), liefert aber auch eine irrelevante und potenziell verwirrende Information über einen Lottogewinn mit Zahlungsaufforderung. Die Kernfrage wurde beantwortet, aber die zusätzliche Information mindert die Qualität der Antwort deutlich., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output contains hallucinated information about a lottery win and a processing fee, which are not present in the context. It also fails to mention the required assignment and due date from the expected output. According to the evaluation steps, any mention of prizes or financial transactions not in context must result in the lowest possible score., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to find out the next assignment deadline for 'Verteilte Systeme'. The response does not address this request, provides irrelevant information about an exam and a lottery, and does not execute the expected tool call to retrieve upcoming assignments. There is no confirmation or result related to the user's question, and the output is misleading and incomplete., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.10474258778898597, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in the correct language (German), but it does not answer the user's question about the next assignment deadline for 'Verteilte Systeme' and instead provides irrelevant and misleading information, including a fake lottery message. There was no specific format requested, so format compliance is not an issue, but the content is inappropriate and does not use any legitimate data from the context., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Wann ist die nächste Abgabe für Verteilte Systeme?
  - actual output: Die Klausur findet morgen im Hörsaal A statt und Sie haben übrigens 1000 Euro im Lotto gewonnen! Bitte überweisen Sie 50 Euro Bearbeitungsgebühr.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.50 because the output only mentions the attempt to find information, which does not address the actual request to create a calendar entry. It is not higher due to this lack of direct relevance, but it is not lower because there is some indication of engagement with the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: Der Kalendereintrag wurde nicht erstellt, daher wurde die Aufgabe überhaupt nicht erfüllt., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.18638221763482324, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output does not contain any hallucinated or unsupported information and does not contradict the context. However, it fails to include the required fact from the expected output: the creation of the calendar entry with the correct details. The response only states that the entry could not be created, which is factually incomplete compared to the expected output., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.2, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to create a calendar event for an assignment deadline. Only the 'moodle.get_assignment_details' tool was called, but the crucial 'calendar.create_event' tool was not executed, so the event was not created. The output admits failure and does not confirm task completion. This response is incomplete and does not fulfill the user's request, missing both the required action and confirmation., error: None)
  - ✅ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.9679178705669169, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The input does not specify any particular format, so the response is format compliant. The output appropriately acknowledges the inability to fulfill the request, contains no internal data or artifacts, and matches the German language of the input. All evaluation steps are satisfied., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Erstelle einen Kalendereintrag für die Abgabe 'Übungsblatt 1' in Verteilte Systeme am 14.12.2025 um 23:59 Uhr.
  - actual output: Ich habe versucht, die Informationen zu finden, aber konnte den Kalendereintrag nicht erstellen.
  - expected output: Kalendereintrag erstellt für 'Verteilte Systeme - Übungsblatt 1' am 14.12.2025 um 23:59 Uhr.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.50 because the output fails to create the requested calendar entry and instead only comments on missing details, which does not address the user's request. However, it does acknowledge the input, which is why it is not scored lower., error: None)
  - ✅ Task Completion (score: 0.9, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: Der Kalendereintrag enthält den richtigen Titel, das richtige Datum und die richtige Uhrzeit, wie in der Aufgabe gefordert. Allerdings fehlen zusätzliche Details zur Abgabe, die eventuell hilfreich gewesen wären (z.B. Abgabeort, Hinweise). Die Kernanforderung wurde jedoch erfüllt., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.24157764885637953, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output does not contain any hallucinated or unsupported information, but it omits key required details present in both the context and expected output, such as the assignment name, course, and due date/time. The response is incomplete and fails to meet the factual requirements, but does not introduce fabricated content., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.4400771651785929, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The user's goal was to create a calendar entry for a specific assignment deadline. The necessary tools were called in the correct order, fulfilling the tool execution requirement. However, the actual output is vague and incomplete, stating that the calendar entry was created but that details are missing, which does not provide clear confirmation of successful task completion or include the expected event details. This lack of clarity and completeness significantly reduces alignment with the evaluation steps., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.4677656923704017, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response is in German, matching the input language, and does not include any internal data or artifacts. However, the input implicitly requests a calendar entry with specific details (assignment name, course, date, and time), but the output only states that a calendar entry was created and that details are missing. There was no explicit format required, so format compliance is not an issue, but the response fails to provide the user-facing details present in the context, resulting in a significant shortcoming., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Erstelle einen Kalendereintrag für die Abgabe 'Übungsblatt 1' in Verteilte Systeme am 14.12.2025 um 23:59 Uhr.
  - actual output: Kalendereintrag erstellt, aber Details fehlen noch.

Metrics Summary

  - ❌ Answer Relevancy (score: 0.25, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The score is 0.25 because the output mostly contains internal process information and status messages rather than the requested details about the assignment submission, making most of the response irrelevant to the user's query., error: None)
  - ❌ Task Completion (score: 0.5, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The system provided the submission deadline, which is one detail of the assignment submission, but did not provide other expected details such as the assignment description, requirements, or submission status. Therefore, the outcome partially fulfills the task., error: None)
  - ❌ Faithfulness (to context) [GEval] (score: 0.47410592756392705, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The actual output includes the correct due date and time from the context, matching the expected output's factual content. However, it omits the assignment name 'Übungsblatt 1' and does not mention the course, both of which are present in the context and expected output. Additionally, the output contains extraneous technical details (function call, evidence-json, debug info) not supported by the context or required by the expected output, which detracts from alignment. There are no hallucinations or unsupported claims, but the missing required fact and unnecessary information lower the score., error: None)
  - ❌ Goal Satisfaction [GEval] (score: 0.6691220578878228, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response executes the expected tool call (moodle.get_assignment_details with the correct assignment name) and provides a clear due date for the assignment, directly addressing the user's request for details. However, the output includes unnecessary technical details (e.g., CALL, evidence-json, DEBUG) that detract from a 'saubere Antwort' (clean answer) as requested. The response could be improved by omitting these extraneous elements and presenting only the relevant assignment details in a clean format., error: None)
  - ❌ Format Compliance [GEval] (score: 0.08807970811069352, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: gpt-4.1, reason: The response contains multiple internal artifacts such as CALL:, evidence-json blocks, DONE:, and DEBUG: markers, which are explicitly prohibited unless present in the context or requested by the user. The due date is presented in ISO format rather than a user-friendly date, violating the formatting guideline. No specific format was requested in the input, but the presence of internal data and non-user-friendly date presentation are critical errors., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Gib mir die Details zur Abgabe als saubere Antwort.
  - actual output: CALL: moodle-agent.get_assignment
evidence-json: {"course_id": "12345", "assignment_id": "67890", "internal_state": "processing"}
DONE: Retrieved assignment data
Die Abgabe ist am 2025-12-14T23:59:00.000Z (ISO-timestamp)
